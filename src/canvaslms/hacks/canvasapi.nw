\chapter{Hackish improvements to the \texttt{canvasapi} module}

In this module we provide some decorators for the classes in the
\texttt{canvasapi} package.
We automatically apply all decorators upon import, so
\begin{minted}{python}
import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi
\end{minted}
would apply all decorators defined herein to the already defined classes in the
\texttt{canvasapi} package.

We do this as follows:
<<canvasapi.py>>=
"""A module that modifies the classes of the canvasapi package"""

import cachetools
import canvasapi.assignment
from canvasapi.user import User
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import functools
import importlib
import inspect
import sys

<<constants>>
<<functions>>

# Loads all hacks
this_module = sys.modules[__name__]

# automatically execute all make_* functions to apply decorators
for name, function in inspect.getmembers(this_module, inspect.isfunction):
  if name.startswith("make_"):
    function()

\section{Testing Canvas API monkey-patches}
\label{sec:hacks:testing}

This module includes comprehensive tests for all monkey-patches applied to [[canvasapi]] classes.
Following literate programming principles, tests are distributed throughout this file, appearing immediately after the functionality they verify.
This pedagogical organization shows: explain problem → implement solution → verify it works.

\subsection{Test organization}

The main test file structure is defined here, then individual test chunks appear after their corresponding implementations:
\begin{description}
\item[Equality and hashability tests] Appear after [[make_classes_comparable()]] (Section~\ref{ComparableObjects})
\item[User string representation tests] Appear after [[make_useful_user_dunder_str()]]
\item[Caching tests] Will appear after caching infrastructure (future sections)
\end{description}

\subsection{The problem: Canvas objects lack equality and hashability}

By default, the [[canvasapi]] library's classes don't define [[__eq__]] or [[__hash__]] methods.
This creates practical problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two [[User]] objects representing the same Canvas user (same ID) are not equal
\item Canvas objects cannot be added to sets
\item Canvas objects cannot be used as dictionary keys
\item The [[User.__str__]] method uses Canvas ID instead of login ID
\end{enumerate}

Our monkey-patches fix these issues by adding proper equality, hashing, and string representation.

\subsection{Variation theory in testing}

When testing monkey-patches, we verify:
\begin{description}
\item[Invariant] The patch is applied once, affects all instances of the class
\item[Variant] Different classes (User, Assignment, Submission), different IDs, different instances
\end{description}

The tests demonstrate \emph{semantic equality}: two objects with the same Canvas ID represent the same entity, even if they are different Python objects.

\subsection{Test file structure}

The main test file imports all necessary modules and references test chunks defined throughout this document:

<<test hacks.py>>=
"""
Tests for canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi monkey-patches.

These tests verify that our decorators correctly add __eq__, __hash__,
and improved __str__ methods to canvasapi classes.

IMPORTANT: These tests import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi, which applies
monkey-patches to canvasapi classes. The patches are applied at import
time and affect all future instances.

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# This import applies the monkey-patches
import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi

from canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi import (
    must_update, merge_kwargs, outdated, NOREFRESH_GRADES, CacheGetMethods
)

<<test equality>>
<<test hashability>>
<<test user string representation>>
@

\subsection{Why monkey-patching is necessary}

Monkey-patching is the right approach here because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The [[canvasapi]] library returns its own class instances
\item We don't control object creation
\item Monkey-patching affects all instances automatically
\item No wrapper conversion needed throughout the codebase
\end{enumerate}

Our tests verify the patches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply correctly at import time
\item Work for all specified classes (User, Assignment, Submission, AssignmentGroup)
\item Enable practical operations (sets, dict keys, equality checks)
\item Improve developer experience (better [[__str__]])
\end{itemize}


\section{Make classes comparable and hashable}\label{ComparableObjects}

Since none of the classes in [[canvasapi]] defines the [[__eq__]] method, they 
all use the default which uses [[is]].
However, in many cases, it makes more sense to actually compare what the 
objects represent.
Consider two [[User]] objects that represent the same user (the same Canvas 
ID), then they should be considered equal, even if the objects themselves are 
different.
<<define decorator for comparable Canvas objects>>=
def canvas_comparable(cls):
  def is_equal(self, other):
    """Tests if Canvas objects self and other refer to the same object"""
    return type(self) == type(other) and self.id == other.id

  cls.__eq__ = is_equal
  return cls
@

The same applies for the hashable property.
A [[User]] object represents a fixed user that never changes, so we can use the 
type and Canvas ID to hash objects.
<<define decorator for hashable Canvas objects>>=
def canvas_hashable(cls):
  def canvas_hash(self):
    """Returns a hash suitable for Canvas objects"""
    return hash(type(self)) ^ hash(self.id)

  cls.__hash__ = canvas_hash
  return cls
@

Adding these two, will allow us to put these objects into sets, for instance.
We sum it up in a function that can be run automatically when including this 
module.
<<functions>>=
def make_classes_comparable():
  """Improves the classes by adding __eq__ and __hash__ methods"""
  <<define decorator for comparable Canvas objects>>
  <<define decorator for hashable Canvas objects>>
  <<improve eq method for classes>>
@

We want to do this for several classes.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
# classes to improve in each module
CANVASAPI_CLASSES = {
  "assignment": ["Assignment", "AssignmentGroup"],
  "submission": ["Submission"],
  "user": ["User"],
  "group": ["GroupCategory", "Group"],
  "module": ["Module"]
}
@

We then want to load all the relevant modules given above.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
canvasapi_modules = {}

# import all modules
for module_name in CANVASAPI_CLASSES:
  canvasapi_modules[module_name] = \
    importlib.import_module(f"canvasapi.{module_name}")
@

Finally, we can go through all the modules and extract their members.
For each member, we check if it's a member to decorate, if so, we apply the 
decorators~[[canvas_comparable]] and [[canvas_hashable]] to it.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
for module_name, module in canvasapi_modules.items():
  module_members = inspect.getmembers(module)
  for obj_name, obj in module_members:
    if obj_name in CANVASAPI_CLASSES[module_name]:
      canvas_comparable(obj)
      canvas_hashable(obj)
@

\subsection{Verifying equality and hashability}

Now that we've implemented the decorators, let's verify they work correctly.
Our tests demonstrate \emph{semantic equality}: two objects with the same Canvas ID represent the same entity, even if they are different Python objects.

\subsubsection{Testing equality (\_\_eq\_\_)}

The [[__eq__]] method should compare Canvas objects by their type and Canvas ID.
Two objects of the same type with the same ID should be equal, even if they are different Python objects.

<<test equality>>=
class TestEqualityMonkeyPatch:
    """Test that Canvas objects can be compared by ID"""

    def test_users_with_same_id_are_equal(self):
        """Two User objects with same ID should be equal"""
        # Test with same mock instance (verifies ID comparison logic)
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345

        # Same object is equal to itself
        assert User.__eq__(user1, user1)

    def test_users_with_different_ids_not_equal(self):
        """Users with different IDs should not be equal"""
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        assert not User.__eq__(user1, user2)

    def test_different_types_not_equal(self):
        """Objects of different types should not be equal, even with same ID"""
        user = MagicMock()
        user.id = 12345

        assignment = MagicMock()
        assignment.id = 12345

        # Different types (checked by type())
        assert not User.__eq__(user, assignment)

    def test_assignments_have_equality_method(self):
        """Assignment class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        assign = MagicMock()
        assign.id = 5001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert Assignment.__eq__(assign, assign)

    def test_submissions_have_equality_method(self):
        """Submission class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        sub = MagicMock()
        sub.id = 6001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert Submission.__eq__(sub, sub)

    def test_assignment_groups_have_equality_method(self):
        """AssignmentGroup class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        group = MagicMock()
        group.id = 2001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert AssignmentGroup.__eq__(group, group)
@

Notice how semantic equality transforms our ability to work with Canvas objects.
Before the patch, comparing objects was meaningless.
After the patch, we can check if two objects represent the same Canvas entity.

\subsubsection{Testing hashability (\_\_hash\_\_)}

The [[__hash__]] method makes Canvas objects usable in sets and as dictionary keys.
This is crucial for deduplication and fast lookup operations.

The hash must be consistent with equality: equal objects must have equal hashes.

<<test hashability>>=
class TestHashabilityMonkeyPatch:
    """Test that Canvas objects can be hashed and used in sets/dicts"""

    def test_users_with_same_id_have_same_hash(self):
        """Equal users should have equal hashes"""
        user = MagicMock()
        user.id = 12345

        # Same object hashed twice should give same hash
        assert User.__hash__(user) == User.__hash__(user)

    def test_users_with_different_ids_have_different_hashes(self):
        """Different users should (usually) have different hashes"""
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        # Different IDs should produce different hashes
        # (hash collisions possible but unlikely)
        assert User.__hash__(user1) != User.__hash__(user2)

    def test_hashability_enables_set_usage(self):
        """
        Patched __hash__ allows Canvas objects to be used in sets.

        This test verifies the method is properly defined, making
        sets and dicts possible (actual usage requires both __eq__
        and __hash__ to work together on real Canvas objects).
        """
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        # Both should be hashable
        hash1 = User.__hash__(user1)
        hash2 = User.__hash__(user2)

        assert isinstance(hash1, int)
        assert isinstance(hash2, int)
        assert hash1 != hash2

    def test_hashability_enables_dict_usage(self):
        """
        Patched __hash__ allows Canvas objects as dictionary keys.

        Verifies the hash method is properly defined and returns
        valid hash values based on type and ID.
        """
        assign1 = MagicMock()
        assign1.id = 5001
        assign2 = MagicMock()
        assign2.id = 5002

        # Both should produce valid hashes
        hash1 = Assignment.__hash__(assign1)
        hash2 = Assignment.__hash__(assign2)

        assert isinstance(hash1, int)
        assert isinstance(hash2, int)
        assert hash1 != hash2
@

These tests demonstrate the power of hashability: we can now use sets for deduplication and dictionaries for fast lookups.
Without these patches, Canvas objects would be unhashable and couldn't be used in these data structures.


\section{Improve User's [[__str__]] method}

By default, [[canvasapi]]'s [[User]] class defines a [[__str__]] dunder method 
that uses the user's name and Canvas ID.
We want to make it more useful, by using the user's name and login ID.
<<functions>>=
def make_useful_user_dunder_str():
  """Improves the user class by changing __str__"""
  <<define [[name_and_login]]>>
  <<update [[User.__str__]] to use [[name_and_login]]>>
@

Now, we simply need to define a function to use as a drop-in replacement for 
the [[__str__]] method.
<<define [[name_and_login]]>>=
def name_and_login(self):
  try:
    return f"{self.name} <{self.login_id}>"
  except AttributeError as err:
    return f"{self.name} <>"
@

Then we simply need to replace the current [[__str__]] method with the new one 
above.
<<update [[User.__str__]] to use [[name_and_login]]>>=
import canvasapi.user
canvasapi.user.User.__str__ = name_and_login
@

\subsection{Verifying the improved string representation}

Now let's verify this improved [[__str__]] method works as intended.
The original [[User.__str__]] method returns something like \enquote{User 12345}.
Our improvement returns \enquote{Alice Anderson <alice>}---much more useful for debugging and logging.

<<test user string representation>>=
class TestUserStringRepresentation:
    """Test improved User.__str__ method"""

    def test_user_str_with_name_and_login(self):
        """User string should show name and login ID"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Alice Anderson"
        user.login_id = "alice"

        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert result == "Alice Anderson <alice>"

    def test_user_str_without_login_id(self):
        """If login_id is missing, show empty brackets"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Bob Brown"
        # Simulate missing login_id attribute
        del user.login_id

        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert result == "Bob Brown <>"

    def test_user_str_useful_for_debugging(self):
        """String representation should be human-readable"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Charlie Chen"
        user.login_id = "cchen"

        # Should not contain Canvas ID or object address
        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert "Charlie Chen" in result
        assert "cchen" in result
        assert "0x" not in result  # No memory address
@

This improved string representation makes debugging much easier.
When you print a list of users or log user actions, you see meaningful names instead of numeric IDs.


\section{Cacheable Canvas objects}

We would like certain methods in certain Canvas objects to be cached.
Particularly, methods that return objects that rarely change should be 
cacheable.
For instance, [[canvas.get_courses()]] returns a list of courses.
This list changes rarely\footnote{%
  This happens four times per year, when IT creates the new Canvas rooms 270 
  days ahead of course start.
  It also happens when someone adds you to manually to a course.
}, so its results can and should be cached.
The list of students changes usually only once in the beginning of the course.

Results on the other hand changes during a course.
However, once a student receives a pass, the result will (usually) not change 
again.
There are these cases however, where a student complements their submission to 
get a higher grade.
But once the student has the highest grade, an A or a P, the result will not 
change.

We will use the [[cachetools]] package to provide suitable caching decorators 
for the [[canvasapi]] classes' methods.
However, in some cases we can't, but need to write our own caching mechanisms.
But this means that we can construct quite complex cache policies.

The general design is this:
We add a cache attribute, then the methods store objects (return values) there.
The [[Canvas]] object stores [[Course]] objects.
Each [[Course]] object stores [[Assignment]] objects.
Each [[Assignment]] object stores [[Submission]] objects.
This means we can store and restore the entire hierarchy just by storing the 
[[Canvas]] object.
If we pickle the [[Canvas]] object, the caches of the [[Course]] objects will 
be in there, the [[Assignment]] caches will in turn be in them, and so on.

When we want to force an update of the courses, we don't want to clear the 
cache.
Then we lose the entire hierarchy.
We can update the list instead of clearing the entire cache hierarchy.
That way we can update objects and keep their caches.
But we'll need a way to know when to update.

\subsection{Syncing caches}

We usually have two methods to cache:
\begin{center}
[[get_x(id, /, **kwargs)]]
\quad
and
\quad
[[get_xs(**kwargs)]].
\end{center}
For example,
\begin{center}
[[get_submission(id, /, **kwargs)]]
\quad
and
\quad
[[get_submissions(**kwargs)]].
\end{center}
These should sync.
In Canvas we can also pass options through keyword arguments, a common one 
being [[include]] which specifies a list of things to include.
For instance, when it comes to submissions we can ask Canvas to include grading 
rubrics.
This means that we want to maintain these details, so that we don't lose 
information in the cache.

This means that we need two functions to support the caching:
\begin{description}
\item [[must_update(prev_kwargs, kwargs)]] takes the old keyword 
arguments ([[prev_kwargs]]) to check if they're a superset of the new keyword 
arguments ([[kwargs]]).
If not, the cache doesn't have all necessary information and we must fetch it.
\item [[merge_kwargs]] will take a list of keyword arguments dictionaries and 
merge them.
Most of the time these contain only the key [[include]] whose value is a list 
of things to include.
So essentially, we want to take the union of all these sets.
\end{description}
We can thus start with the following defaults:
<<kwargs functions caches>>=
def must_update(prev_kwargs, new_kwargs,
                ignore_keys=[
                  <<keys to ignore>>
                ]):
  """
  Returns True if we must update the cache (refetch).

  <<doc for keys to ignore>>
  """
  for key, value in new_kwargs.items():
    # Skip ignored keys (like sorting parameters)
    if key in ignore_keys:
      continue

    if key not in prev_kwargs:
      return True
    elif isinstance(value, list):
      if set(value) > set(prev_kwargs[key]):
        return True
    elif value != prev_kwargs[key]:
      return True

  return False

def merge_kwargs(kwargs_list,
                 ignore_keys=[
                   <<keys to ignore>>
                 ]):
  """
  Merges a list of keyword arguments dictionaries. Lists are unioned.
  All non-list keys (usually strings) must be the same in all dictionaries.

  <<doc for keys to ignore>>
  """
  new_kwargs = dict()

  for kwargs in kwargs_list:
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
      if key not in new_kwargs:
        new_kwargs[key] = value
      elif isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(new_kwargs[key], list):
        # Convert both to lists if either is a list, then union
        prev_val = new_kwargs[key] if isinstance(new_kwargs[key], list) \
                   else [new_kwargs[key]]
        curr_val = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
        new_kwargs[key] = list(set(prev_val) | set(curr_val))
      else:
        <<if [[key]] can be ignored>>:
          new_kwargs[key] = value
        elif value != new_kwargs[key]:
          raise ValueError(f"Cannot merge {key} with "
                           f"{value} and {new_kwargs[key]}")

  return new_kwargs
@

We can now define the keys to ignore.
There are some keys that can be ignored for our purposes, like sorting order, 
as they don't affect the caching.
In those cases, we simply use the last value, as seen in the loop above.
<<doc for keys to ignore>>=
By default, we ignore the keys

  <<keys to ignore>>

as they don't affect the caching.
<<keys to ignore>>=
"sort",
"order",
"order_by"
@

To check if a key can be ignored, we simply check if it's in the [[ignore_keys]]
list.
<<if [[key]] can be ignored>>=
if key in ignore_keys
@

These utility functions are part of the caching infrastructure.
<<functions>>=
<<kwargs functions caches>>
@

Now let's verify these kwargs functions work correctly with comprehensive tests.

\subsubsection{Verifying [[must_update]]}

The [[must_update]] function determines when we need to refetch from the API.
We'll test both cases where the cache is sufficient and where it needs updating.

<<test must update>>=
class TestMustUpdate:
    """Test must_update() cache invalidation logic"""

    def test_no_update_when_cache_has_all_data(self):
        """Cache with all requested data should not update"""
        prev = {"include": ["submissions", "rubric"]}
        new = {"include": ["submissions"]}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_no_update_when_kwargs_identical(self):
        """Identical kwargs should not trigger update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"], "enrollment_type": "student"}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "enrollment_type": "student"}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_update_when_new_key_not_in_cache(self):
        """New key not in cache should trigger update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"]}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "enrollment_type": "student"}

        assert must_update(prev, new)

    def test_update_when_list_needs_more_items(self):
        """Cache missing list items should trigger update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"]}
        new = {"include": ["user", "enrollments"]}

        assert must_update(prev, new)

    def test_update_when_non_list_value_differs(self):
        """Different non-list value should trigger update"""
        prev = {"enrollment_type": "student"}
        new = {"enrollment_type": "teacher"}

        assert must_update(prev, new)

    def test_no_update_when_cache_has_superset(self):
        """Cache with more data than needed should not update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user", "enrollments", "email"]}
        new = {"include": ["user", "enrollments"]}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_ignores_sort_keys(self):
        """Sorting keys should be ignored (don't affect cache)"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"], "sort": "name"}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "sort": "created_at"}

        # Different sort order shouldn't trigger update
        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_ignores_order_keys(self):
        """Order parameter should be ignored"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"], "order": "asc"}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "order": "desc"}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_empty_new_kwargs_no_update(self):
        """Empty new kwargs should not trigger update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"]}
        new = {}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_empty_prev_kwargs_triggers_update(self):
        """Empty cache with new requests should trigger update"""
        prev = {}
        new = {"include": ["user"]}

        assert must_update(prev, new)
@

We add this test chunk to the test file.
<<test hacks.py>>=
<<test must update>>
@

\subsubsection{Verifying [[merge_kwargs]]}

The [[merge_kwargs]] function combines multiple kwargs dictionaries, unioning
list values and ensuring non-list values are consistent.

<<test merge kwargs>>=
class TestMergeKwargs:
    """Test merge_kwargs() dictionary merging logic"""

    def test_empty_list_returns_empty_dict(self):
        """Empty list should return empty dictionary"""
        result = merge_kwargs([])

        assert result == {}

    def test_single_dict_returns_copy(self):
        """Single dictionary should be returned as-is"""
        kwargs = {"include": ["user"], "enrollment_type": "student"}
        result = merge_kwargs([kwargs])

        assert result == kwargs

    def test_unions_list_values(self):
        """List values should be unioned"""
        kwargs1 = {"include": ["user"]}

\subsection{Wrapping the methods with a caching decorator}

Now, let's turn our attention to the caching decorator.
We want to cover both the singular and plural methods.
So this decorator should be applied to the class, for instance the 
[[Assignment]] class with the attribute [[submission]] to cache
[[get_submission]] and [[get_submissions]].
<<general class decorator for caching get methods>>=
class CacheGetMethods:
  """
  General class decorator to add caching to get_*{,s} methods.

  <<notes in [[CacheGetMethods]] doc>>
  """
  def __init__(self, attribute_name, cache=None, include_plural=True,
               include_singular=True, plural_name=None):
    """No parameters required"""
    self.__attribute_name = attribute_name
    self.__include_plural = include_plural
    self.__include_singular = include_singular
    self.__plural_name = plural_name
    self.__cache = cache if cache else {}

  def __call__(self, cls):
    """Applies the decorator to the class cls"""
    <<create decorator functions and update [[cls]]>>
    return cls
@ If we want to cache several attributes, then we can simply apply this decorator
several times.
For instance, the [[Course]] class has both [[assignments]] and [[users]].

Some Canvas API entities only provide plural methods (e.g.,
[[get_assignment_groups()]] but no [[get_assignment_group()]]).
For these, we use [[include_singular=False]].

We need to update two methods in sync, the [[get_x]] and [[get_xs]] methods.
This is why we can't just use the decorators from [[cachetools]] or similar.
<<create decorator functions and update [[cls]]>>=
<<update constructor with new attributes>>

if self.__include_singular:
  <<update the singular method>>

if self.__include_plural:
  <<update the plural method>>
@

Now let's verify the decorator initialization works correctly.

\subsubsection{Verifying [[CacheGetMethods]] initialization}

The decorator must accept various configuration parameters and apply itself
correctly to classes.

<<test cache get methods init>>=
class TestCacheGetMethodsInit:
    """Test CacheGetMethods decorator initialization"""

    def test_default_parameters(self):
        """Default parameters should create empty cache and include both methods"""
        decorator = CacheGetMethods("assignment")

        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__attribute_name == "assignment"
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__cache == {}
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_singular is True
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_plural is True
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__plural_name is None

    def test_custom_cache_parameter(self):
        """Custom cache dict should be stored"""
        custom_cache = {1: ("obj1", {}), 2: ("obj2", {})}
        decorator = CacheGetMethods("user", cache=custom_cache)

        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__cache is custom_cache

    def test_include_singular_false(self):
        """include_singular=False should store False"""
        decorator = CacheGetMethods("assignment_group", include_singular=False)

        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_singular is False
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_plural is True

    def test_include_plural_false(self):
        """include_plural=False should store False"""
        decorator = CacheGetMethods("submission", include_plural=False)

        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_plural is False
        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__include_singular is True

    def test_custom_plural_name(self):
        """plural_name parameter should override default pluralization"""
        decorator = CacheGetMethods("group_category",
                                     plural_name="group_categories")

        assert decorator._CacheGetMethods__plural_name == "group_categories"

    def test_decorator_returns_modified_class(self):
        """Decorator should return the class to allow stacking"""
        class DummyClass:
            def __init__(self):
                pass

            def get_test(self, test_id):
                return MagicMock(id=test_id)

            def get_tests(self):
                return []

        decorator = CacheGetMethods("test")
        result = decorator(DummyClass)

        assert result is DummyClass
@

<<test hacks.py>>=
<<test cache get methods init>>
@

We must update the constructor so that the object that is created keeps the
cache.
To update the constructor, we simply wrap it in a new constructor that simply 
adds the desired attributes.

Note that the cache stored in the constructor must be named specifically to the
attribute at hand.
Otherwise, when we cache several attributes, they will all use the same cache
named [[cache]].
This will not work.
So they must be named [[submission_cache]], for example.

We capture [[attr_name]] as a closure variable on line~358.
This is crucial for correct decorator behavior when multiple decorators are
applied to the same class.
We must \emph{not} store [[attr_name]] as an instance attribute (like
[[self.attr_name]]) because that would be shared across all decorator
applications.
For example, if we decorate [[Course]] with both [[CacheGetMethods("assignment")]]
and [[CacheGetMethods("user")]], storing as [[self.attr_name]] would cause the
second decorator to overwrite the first decorator's value, making both use
``user'' incorrectly.
By using the closure variable [[attr_name]], each decorator captures its own
value that remains constant throughout the wrapper functions' lifetime.
<<update constructor with new attributes>>=
init = cls.__init__
attr_name = self.__attribute_name

@functools.wraps(init)
def new_init(*args, **kwargs):
  self = args[0]
  <<construct [[attr_name]] cache attributes in [[self]]>>
  init(*args, **kwargs)

cls.__init__ = new_init
@

We do the same thing for the singular and plural get methods.
We get the original method, then wrap it in a new method that adds suitable 
caching or falls back to the original [[get_*]] function.
<<update the singular method>>=
singular_name = f"get_{self.__attribute_name}"
get_attr = getattr(cls, singular_name)

@functools.wraps(get_attr)
def new_get_attr(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attr]]>>

setattr(cls, singular_name, new_get_attr)
<<update the plural method>>=
if self.__plural_name:
  plural_name = f"get_{self.__plural_name}"
else:
  plural_name = f"get_{self.__attribute_name}s"
get_attrs = getattr(cls, plural_name)

@functools.wraps(get_attrs)
def new_get_attrs(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attrs]]>>

setattr(cls, plural_name, new_get_attrs)
@

\subsection{Caching the get methods}

The idea of the caching is as follows.
If the plural method ([[get_xs]]) is called, we fetch all items if they haven't 
been fetched before.
If the singular method ([[get_x]]) is called, we check for the request in the 
cache, otherwise we fetch it.
Each request can specify that Canvas should include extra data.
We don't want to lose data, so when making a new call, we first check what data 
has been fetched, so that we never lose data from the cache.

To be able to handle caching, we need attributes to keep track of the cache and 
if we've fetched all objects.
Even if we've fetched all objects, there might be new objects added at times.
So periodically, we must refetch all objects even if we've previously fetched 
them---but only when a sufficient amount of time has passed.
So we'll let the [[_all_fetched]] attribute be a [[datetime]] object, or 
[[None]] if it was never fetched.
<<construct [[attr_name]] cache attributes in [[self]]>>=
if not hasattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache"):
  setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache", {})
if not hasattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched"):
  setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched", None)
@

Now let's verify cache attributes are properly injected into instances.

\subsubsection{Verifying cache attribute injection}

When the decorator modifies a class constructor, it must inject the cache
attributes into every instance.

<<test cache attribute injection>>=
class TestCacheAttributeInjection:
    """Test cache attributes are injected into decorated class instances"""

    def test_creates_cache_attribute(self):
        """Instances should have {attr}_cache attribute"""

    def test_cache_initialized_empty(self):
        """Cache should be initialized as empty dict"""

        assert 1 in instance1.item_cache
        assert 1 not in instance2.item_cache

                return MagicMock(id=item_id)
            def get_items(self):
                return []

        CacheGetMethods("item")(TestClass)
        instance = TestClass(42)

        assert instance.value == 42
        assert hasattr(instance, "item_cache")
@

<<test hacks.py>>=
<<test cache attribute injection>>
@

In all [[get_attr]] requests, it's the positional arguments ([[*args]]) that 
identify what to get.
The keyword arguments ([[**kwargs]]) specify additional options.
However, in most cases the [[*args]] will only contain one element, and that is 
an ID.
<<notes in [[CacheGetMethods]] doc>>=
We assume that the first positional argument is the ID of the object to fetch.
This must be the same as the `.id` attribute of an object (`obj.id`).

Parameters:
  attribute_name: The attribute name to cache (e.g., "assignment", "user").
  cache: Optional initial cache dictionary (default: {}).
  include_plural: Whether to cache the plural method get_*s (default: True).
  include_singular: Whether to cache the singular method get_* (default: True).
  plural_name: Custom plural name for irregular plurals (default: None, uses
               attribute_name + "s"). For example, "group_categories" instead
               of "group_categorys".
@

This allows us to specify how the cache is structured.
We'll let the cache be a dictionary where the key is the ID of the object.
The value will be a tuple of the object and the keyword arguments used to fetch 
it.
For example:
\begin{minted}{text}
{
  1: (obj1, kwargs1),
  2: (obj2, kwargs2),
  ...
}
\end{minted}
<<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attr]]>>=
attr_cache = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache")

<<let [[id]] be the ID of the object to fetch>>

try:
  obj, prev_kwargs = attr_cache[id]
except KeyError:
  obj = None
  prev_kwargs = {}

if obj and (must_update(prev_kwargs, kwargs) or outdated(obj)):
  obj = None

if not obj:
  obj = get_attr(self, *args, **kwargs)
  obj._fetched_at = datetime.now()
  attr_cache[obj.id] = (obj, kwargs)

return obj
@

We already saw [[must_update]] above.
That one focuses on the keyword arguments.
We'll return to the [[outdated]] function later, that one determines from the 
object itself if it needs updating.

The [[get_*]] methods all take either an ID or an object as argument.
If it's an object, then we can get the ID from that object.
<<let [[id]] be the ID of the object to fetch>>=
try:
  obj = args[0]
  id = obj.id
except IndexError:
  raise TypeError(f"{singular_name}() missing 1 required positional "
                  f"argument: 'id'")
except AttributeError:
  if isinstance(obj, int):
    id = obj
  else:
    raise TypeError(f"{singular_name}() argument 1 must be int or "
                    f"Canvas object, not {type(obj)}")
@

Now let's verify the singular method caching works correctly.

Now, let's turn to the plural method.
We have the obvious case that we must fetch all if we haven't fetched all 
before.
But after this it gets more interesting.
If we have fetched all, we must check if the previous [[kwargs]] are a superset
of the new [[kwargs]].
If not, we must fetch all again with the extended [[kwargs]].
However, even if we can reuse the cache, we must check each object if it
requires updating.
For instance, if it's a submission and the grade is not P, then we must update
it.

The key logic is that we have two distinct paths:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bulk fetch path} ([[if not attr_all_fetched]]): When cache is
  empty or stale, we do one bulk API call to fetch all objects and populate the
  cache.
  We then yield all objects without individual staleness checks.
  This is efficient because all objects are fresh from the bulk fetch.
\item \textbf{Cached path} ([[else]]): When cache is already populated and
  fresh, we yield objects from cache, checking each for staleness.
  If an object is outdated (e.g., submission without passing grade older than 5
  minutes), we fetch that individual object.
  This avoids refetching everything when only a few items need updating.
\end{enumerate}
The [[else]] is critical to avoid the double-yield bug: without it, we would
yield all objects once from the bulk fetch, then yield them all again while
checking for staleness, causing N individual API calls for outdated items
immediately after a bulk fetch.
<<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attrs]]>>=
attr_cache = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache")
attr_all_fetched = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched")

if attr_all_fetched:
  for _, prev_kwargs in attr_cache.values():
    if must_update(prev_kwargs, kwargs):
      attr_all_fetched = None
      break

if not attr_all_fetched:
  <<fetch all and populate [[attr_cache]]>>
  <<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]]>>
else:
  <<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]], update individual entries if needed>>
@

To fetch all again, we must merge the keyword arguments.
This is done with the [[merge_kwargs]] function.
Then we must add each object to the cache.
<<fetch all and populate [[attr_cache]]>>=
union_kwargs = merge_kwargs(
  [kwargs for _, kwargs in attr_cache.values()] + [kwargs])

for obj in get_attrs(self, *args, **union_kwargs):
  old_entry = attr_cache.get(obj.id, None)
  if old_entry:
    old_obj, _ = old_entry
    <<update [[obj]] with cache from [[old_obj]]>>
  obj._fetched_at = datetime.now()
  attr_cache[obj.id] = (obj, union_kwargs)

setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched", datetime.now())
attr_all_fetched = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched")
@

Finally, when we want to return all the objects, we will yield them instead.
It's more efficient to use a generator in this case, as that would make us 
update when (if) needed.
When we update an object, we should use the same keyword arguments as specified 
in the cache---not the requested ones---because these will, at this point, be 
the largest possible set of keyword arguments.
<<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]], update individual entries if needed>>=
for obj, obj_kwargs in attr_cache.values():
  if outdated(obj):
    obj = get_attr(self, obj.id, **obj_kwargs)
  yield obj
<<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]]>>=
for obj, _ in attr_cache.values():
  yield obj
@

This completes the [[CacheGetMethods]] class decorator, which we add to the module's
functions.
<<functions>>=
<<general class decorator for caching get methods>>

Now let's verify the plural method caching works correctly.

\subsection{Copy cache to new object}

When we update all objects, we want to keep the caches of every old object.
Otherwise, whenever we update all objects we lose all caches further down the 
hierarchy.
When we construct a new object, we want to copy the cache from the old object.

We can do this by finding all cache-related attributes and copying them.
The problem is that we don't know what attributes an object has caches for.
So we'll do some pattern matching on the attribute names.
We'll look for attributes that end with [[_cache]] and [[_all_fetched]].

Note that we use [[cache_attr_name]] as the loop variable, not [[attr_name]].
This is critical to avoid shadowing the closure variable [[attr_name]] that was
captured in line~371.
If we used [[attr_name]] as the loop variable, Python would treat it as a local
variable throughout the entire [[new_get_attrs]] function, causing an
[[UnboundLocalError]] when we try to access it before the loop (in
lines~494--495).
<<update [[obj]] with cache from [[old_obj]]>>=
for cache_attr_name in dir(old_obj):
  if cache_attr_name.endswith("_cache") or cache_attr_name.endswith("_all_fetched"):
    setattr(obj, cache_attr_name, getattr(old_obj, cache_attr_name))
@

Now let's verify cache synchronization preserves hierarchical caches.

losing cached data down the hierarchy.

\subsection{Testing outdated objects}

Now we'll deal with the [[outdated]] function.
We simply test different attributes of the object.
If we find values indicating that we want to refresh it, we return [[True]].
<<function [[outdated]] to test if an object is outdated>>=
def outdated(obj):
  """Returns True if the object obj is outdated"""
  <<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>
  return False
@

The obvious case is the grade on a submission.
Submissions with passing grades that can't be improved (A, P, P+, complete) are
cached forever.
Submissions without passing grades are cached with a 5-minute TTL, allowing
students to submit work and see updated grades relatively quickly without
overwhelming the Canvas API.
<<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>=
try:
  if obj.grade not in NOREFRESH_GRADES:
    <<check if submission TTL has expired>>
except AttributeError:
  pass
@

For submissions without passing grades, we check if the 5-minute TTL has
expired.
If the object has no [[_fetched_at]] attribute, we treat it as outdated to
ensure it gets refreshed.
<<check if submission TTL has expired>>=
try:
  if datetime.now() - obj._fetched_at > timedelta(minutes=5):
    return True
except AttributeError:
  return True
@

Instinctively, we might want to use all passing grades as the grades that don't 
need refreshing.
However, even if a student has gotten a B, they might want to improve their 
grade.
So the only grades that we should use are passing grades that can't be
improved.
<<constants>>=
NOREFRESH_GRADES = ["A", "P", "P+", "complete"]
@

Let's verify this constant contains exactly the expected grade values.

\subsubsection{Verifying [[NOREFRESH_GRADES]]}

<<test norefresh grades>>=
class TestNorefreshGrades:
    """Test NOREFRESH_GRADES constant definition"""

    def test_contains_expected_grades(self):
        """Should contain all non-improvable passing grades"""
        assert "A" in NOREFRESH_GRADES
        assert "P" in NOREFRESH_GRADES
        assert "P+" in NOREFRESH_GRADES
        assert "complete" in NOREFRESH_GRADES

    def test_excludes_improvable_grades(self):
        """Should not contain improvable grades"""
        assert "B" not in NOREFRESH_GRADES
        assert "C" not in NOREFRESH_GRADES
        assert "F" not in NOREFRESH_GRADES

    def test_has_correct_count(self):
        """Should contain exactly 4 grade values"""
        assert len(NOREFRESH_GRADES) == 4
@

<<test hacks.py>>=
<<test norefresh grades>>
@

Another thing that we can do is to periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] 
flag.
If we set it to [[None]], then we'll fetch all objects again.
So we can check this value to see if a sufficient amount of time has passed for 
us to reset it.
Note, however, that for this case we shouldn't return [[True]] or [[False]], 
since it's not the object itself that is outdated.
We don't need to refetch this object, just for it to refetch its children.
<<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>=
for attr_name in dir(obj):
  <<reset [[_all_fetched]] if necessary>>
@

We want to periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] date so that we periodically 
try to refetch all data.
This interval will be different for different attributes.
But we add a default of 7 days.
<<reset [[_all_fetched]] if necessary>>=
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>
elif attr_name.endswith("_all_fetched"):
  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=7):
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

We don't want them to refresh at the same time, so we'll need to have the 
intervals coprime.
The default 7 is a prime, so everything will be coprime with it.

Students can be added every now and then.
So it will be useful to refetch them quite often.
For instance, they're added at the beginning of the course, might fail to
register and get removed, then readded when they're registered.
Also, when a student reregister for the course, that might happen at any time.
So a rather short interval is useful.
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>=

  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=2):
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

Groups and group categories are more dynamic than assignment structure but less
dynamic than user enrollments.
Students are organized into groups for collaborative work, and group membership
can change during the course (though less frequently than enrollment changes).
We use 5 days as a compromise between freshness and API efficiency.
The prime number 5 ensures cache refreshes don't align with other attributes.

The [[outdated]] function is used by the caching decorator to check if cached
objects need refreshing.
<<functions>>=
<<function [[outdated]] to test if an object is outdated>>
@

Now let's verify the [[outdated]] function works correctly for different
submission states and timestamps.

\subsubsection{Verifying [[outdated]]}

The [[outdated]] function determines when cached submissions should be
refreshed based on grade values and time-to-live.

<<test outdated>>=
class TestOutdated:
    """Test outdated() cache expiration logic"""

    def test_passing_grade_a_not_outdated(self):

\subsection{Caching courses}

The list of courses changes whenever new courses are created that we have
access to.
This usually happens well in advance, so we could have a rather long
time-to-live on the courses cache.

We use the [[CacheGetMethods]] decorator to add caching to the [[Canvas]] class
for its [[get_course]] and [[get_courses]] methods.
The decorator takes the attribute name [[course]] as argument.
<<functions>>=
def make_canvas_courses_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.canvas
  canvasapi.canvas.Canvas = CacheGetMethods("course")(canvasapi.canvas.Canvas)
@

Note that we don't need a TTLCache here, since the [[outdated]] function will
periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] flag to trigger a refetch.


\subsection{Caching course contents}

Each course has assignments and users (students, teachers, TAs).
These change relatively infrequently:
Assignments are typically created at the beginning of the course and rarely
change after that.
Users are added at the beginning and occasionally during the course.

We use [[CacheGetMethods]] to cache both [[assignment]] and [[user]] attributes
of the [[Course]] class.
<<functions>>=
def make_course_contents_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("assignment")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("user")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
@


\subsection{Caching course structure}

Courses have structural elements that change very rarely after the course is
set up: assignment groups, modules, group categories, and groups.
These are typically created at course design time and remain stable throughout
the course.

Assignment groups organize assignments into categories (e.g., "Labs",
"Assignments", "Exams").
They're used frequently for filtering but almost never change after setup.
The Canvas API only provides [[get_assignment_groups()]] (plural), not a
singular [[get_assignment_group()]] method.
We use [[CacheGetMethods]] with [[include_singular=False]] to cache only the
plural method.
<<functions>>=
def make_course_assignment_groups_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("assignment_group",
    include_singular=False)(canvasapi.course.Course)
@

Modules represent the learning structure of a course.
They're used for filtering assignments and rarely change after initial setup.
Similar to assignment groups, the Canvas API only provides [[get_modules()]]
(plural), so we cache with [[include_singular=False]].
<<functions>>=
def make_course_modules_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("module",
    include_singular=False)(canvasapi.course.Course)
@

Group categories and groups organize students for collaborative work.
They're set up at course start or when group projects begin and change
infrequently.
The Canvas API only provides plural methods ([[get_group_categories()]],
[[get_groups()]]), not singular methods.
Note that groups can be fetched from both [[Course]] and [[GroupCategory]]
objects, so we cache on both.
For [[group_category]], the plural is irregular (``categories'' not
``categorys''), so we specify [[plural_name="group_categories"]].
<<functions>>=
def make_course_groups_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  import canvasapi.group
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("group_category",
    include_singular=False, plural_name="group_categories")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("group",
    include_singular=False)(canvasapi.course.Course)
  canvasapi.group.GroupCategory = CacheGetMethods("group",
    include_singular=False)(canvasapi.group.GroupCategory)
@


\subsection{Lazy-loading submissions}

The current caching approach has an inefficiency: when we call
[[get_submissions()]], we immediately check if each cached submission needs
updating and refresh it if necessary.
However, in many workflows we filter the submission list to access only a few
submissions (e.g., filtering by user or assignment).
This means we waste API calls refreshing submissions we never actually use.

\subsubsection{Contrasting eager and lazy loading}

Consider this usage pattern:
\begin{minted}{python}
submissions = assignment.get_submissions()
filtered = [s for s in submissions if s.user_id == target_user]
print(filtered[0].grade)
\end{minted}

With \emph{eager loading} (the old approach):
\begin{enumerate}
\item [[get_submissions()]] returns 50 cached submissions
\item We check each submission: is it stale? Does it need refresh?
\item We make 50 API calls to refresh non-final grades
\item We filter to 1 submission
\item We access the grade (already fresh)
\end{enumerate}

With \emph{lazy loading} (the new approach):
\begin{enumerate}
\item [[get_submissions()]] returns 50 wrapped submissions (no API calls)
\item We filter to 1 submission (wrapper objects pass through filters)
\item We access the grade attribute
\item The wrapper detects access to mutable attribute, checks staleness
\item We make 1 API call to refresh only the accessed submission
\end{enumerate}

The performance improvement is dramatic when filtering: \textbf{1 API call instead
of 50}.

\subsubsection{Design: LazySubmission wrapper}

We implement lazy loading using a transparent wrapper class that intercepts
attribute access.
The wrapper stores the original submission and assignment reference, allowing it
to refresh itself when needed.

Key design decisions:
\begin{description}
\item[Mutable attributes] Only certain attributes change over time: grade,
  grading dates, rubrics, submission data, comments, attachments, and submission
  body.
  We track these and trigger refresh only when they're accessed.
\item[Final grade policy] Submissions with final grades (A, P, P+, complete)
  are never refreshed, maintaining the existing [[NOREFRESH_GRADES]] policy.
\item[Time-based staleness] We use the existing [[outdated()]] function
  with 5-minute TTL for non-final grades.
\item[Preserved includes] The wrapper stores the original [[include]]
  parameters from [[get_submissions()]] to ensure refreshes request the
  same data.
\item[Cache updates] When a wrapper refreshes, it updates its internal state.
  Since the cache holds references to wrapper objects, the cache automatically
  reflects the update.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Implementation: LazySubmission class}

The [[LazySubmission]] class wraps a submission object and intercepts
attribute access using [[__getattribute__]].

<<LazySubmission class>>=
class LazySubmission:
  """
  Transparent wrapper for Submission objects that lazily refreshes on access.

  <<pickle support for LazySubmission>>
@

\subsubsection{Pickle support for cache persistence}

The [[LazySubmission]] wrapper must support pickling to enable cache
persistence.
When the [[Canvas]] object is saved to disk (see cache.nw), Python's
[[pickle]] module serializes the entire object hierarchy, including all
cached submissions.

\paragraph{The pickling challenge}

Python's [[pickle]] cannot serialize certain objects, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function and method references (unless they're module-level functions)
\item Lambda functions
\item Generator objects
\item Objects with circular references to unpicklable objects
\end{itemize}

Our [[LazySubmission]] stores [[_original_get_submission]], which is
a reference to the original (unwrapped) [[get_submission]] method.
This is a \emph{bound method} when called, but we store the \emph{unbound
function} from the decorator's closure.
Method objects are not picklable by default.

\paragraph{The solution: reconstruct from closure}

We implement [[__getstate__]] and [[__setstate__]] to handle
pickling:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Before pickling} ([[__getstate__]]): Exclude the
  unpicklable [[_original_get_submission]] from the state dictionary.
  Save only the submission, assignment reference, includes list, and last
  refresh timestamp.
\item \textbf{After unpickling} ([[__setstate__]]): Reconstruct
  [[_original_get_submission]] by searching the decorator's closure.
  The decorated method stores the original in its [[__closure__]]
  attribute, which we can access via
  [[assignment.__class__.get_submission]].
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Why closure search works}

When the [[cache_submissions]] decorator wraps
[[Assignment.get_submission]], it captures the original method in a
closure variable (line~1072 in the decorator):
\begin{minted}{python}
original_get_submission = cls.get_submission
\end{minted}

This variable is referenced by the [[new_get_submission]] function,
making it part of the function's closure.
After unpickling, we can access this closure via the class's decorated method.

\paragraph{Limitations and failure modes}

This approach has several limitations:
\begin{description}
\item[Version compatibility] If the decorator implementation changes between
  pickle and unpickle (e.g., code upgrade), the closure structure may differ,
  causing reconstruction to fail.
\item[Closure ambiguity] If multiple callable objects exist in the closure with
  \enquote{get\_submission} in their name, we might retrieve the wrong one.
  The heuristic checks for callables with matching names.
\item[Graceful degradation] If reconstruction fails, we set
  [[_original_get_submission]] to [[None]].
  The wrapper remains functional for read-only access (attributes pass through
  to the wrapped submission), but calling [[_refresh()]] will fail.
  This is acceptable because:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cache files are typically invalidated on code changes
  \item The user can clear the cache manually if issues arise
  \item Better to have stale data than a complete crash
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\paragraph{Alternative approaches considered}

We considered but rejected these alternatives:
\begin{description}
\item[Storing method name as string] Reconstruct via
  [[getattr(assignment, 'get_submission')]].
  Problem: This retrieves the \emph{decorated} method, not the original,
  causing infinite recursion or double-wrapping.
\item[Not using a wrapper] Store a \enquote{needs refresh} flag on the
  submission itself.
  Problem: Mutating Canvas API objects is fragile and breaks the lazy-loading
  design.
\item[Store assignment ID, re-fetch assignment] Reconstruct the entire context
  from IDs.
  Problem: Defeats the purpose of caching; would require API calls just to
  restore cache state.
\end{description}

Now we implement the pickle support:
<<pickle support for LazySubmission>>=
def __getstate__(self):
  """
  Prepare object for pickling.

  We can't pickle method references, so we exclude _original_get_submission.
  It will be restored from the decorator's closure during unpickling.
  """
  state = {
    '_submission': object.__getattribute__(self, '_submission'),
    '_assignment': object.__getattribute__(self, '_assignment'),
    '_includes': object.__getattribute__(self, '_includes'),
    '_last_refresh': object.__getattribute__(self, '_last_refresh'),
  }
  return state

def __setstate__(self, state):
  """
  Restore object after unpickling.

  Restore all attributes from state, and reconstruct _original_get_submission
  by searching the decorator's closure for the original method.
  """
  for key, value in state.items():
    object.__setattr__(self, key, value)

  # Restore the original method from the assignment's decorated method
  # The decorated method has the original in its closure
  assignment = state['_assignment']
  decorated_method = assignment.__class__.get_submission

  # The original method is captured in the decorator's closure
  # We can access it via the closure of the decorated method
  # The decorated method's __closure__ contains the original method
  try:
    # Find the original_get_submission in the closure
    for cell in decorated_method.__closure__:
      try:
        obj = cell.cell_contents
        # Check if it's a callable with the right name
        if callable(obj) and hasattr(obj, '__name__') and \
           'get_submission' in obj.__name__:
          object.__setattr__(self, '_original_get_submission', obj)
          break
      except (AttributeError, ValueError):
        continue
  except (AttributeError, TypeError):
    # If we can't find it in closure, fall back to None
    # This means refresh won't work, but at least unpickling succeeds
    object.__setattr__(self, '_original_get_submission', None)
@

This class is used by the caching decorator below.
<<functions>>=
<<LazySubmission class>>
@

\subsection{Caching submissions}

For the results, we can construct something more specific.
Results that we're interested in are submissions.
We can only get submission from an assignment object.
We can either get all submissions, or one specific submission if we specify the
user.

Canvas's [[get_submissions()]] method accepts a [[bucket]] parameter to filter
submissions server-side (e.g., [[bucket="ungraded"]]).
However, this caching implementation does not track the [[bucket]] parameter in
the cache key.

This is intentional: tracking [[bucket]] would require separate caches for
different bucket values, complicating the cache hierarchy and potentially
causing inconsistencies.
Instead, client code (particularly [[submissions.nw]] and [[assignments.nw]])
performs local filtering on the complete submission list.

This design ensures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cache keys are unambiguous (based only on user ID).
\item Lazy loading works correctly (submissions refresh based on staleness, not
bucket parameter).
\item Cache hierarchy is preserved (course caches contain assignment caches
contain submission caches).
\end{itemize}

See \cref{SubmissionsFiltering} in [[submissions.nw]] for the local filtering
implementation.

Now we combine the caching mechanism with lazy loading.
The cache stores \texttt{LazySubmission} wrappers instead of raw submissions.
This means submissions are only refreshed when their attributes are actually
accessed, not when the list is returned.
<<functions>>=
def make_assignment_submissions_cacheable():
  def cache_submissions(cls):
    """Class decorator for cacheable get_submission, get_submissions methods"""
    <<decorator body for caching assignment submissions>>
    return cls

  canvasapi.assignment.Assignment = \
    cache_submissions(canvasapi.assignment.Assignment)
@

Then we can write the decorator as follows.
We need to add a cache attribute in the constructor, so we must decorate the
constructor.
We must also store the original [[get_submission]] method before decorating it,
because [[LazySubmission]] needs to call it directly to avoid double-wrapping.
Then we must decorate both [[get_submission]] and [[get_submissions]].
<<decorator body for caching assignment submissions>>=
old_constructor = cls.__init__

@functools.wraps(cls.__init__)
def new_init(*args, **kwargs):
  <<extend class constructor for decorators>>
  old_constructor(*args, **kwargs)

cls.__init__ = new_init

# Store original method before wrapping (needed by LazySubmission)
original_get_submission = cls.get_submission
get_submission = cls.get_submission

@functools.wraps(cls.get_submission)
def new_get_submission(self, user, **kwargs):
  <<return submission of user>>

cls.get_submission = new_get_submission

get_submissions = cls.get_submissions

@functools.wraps(cls.get_submissions)
def new_get_submissions(self, **kwargs):
  <<return a list of all submissions>>

cls.get_submissions = new_get_submissions
@

We decorate the method to get a specific submission, [[get_submission]].
With lazy loading, we wrap the submission in [[LazySubmission]] and cache the
wrapper.
The wrapper will handle staleness checking and refresh only when attributes are
accessed.
For this, we first need a cache attribute.
<<extend class constructor for decorators>>=
args[0].__cache = {}
@

Now we can treat how we get an individual submission.
The logic is simplified compared to the eager approach: we only fetch if not in
cache or if new includes are requested.
We no longer check [[NOREFRESH_GRADES]] here---that's handled by
[[LazySubmission._needs_refresh()]].
<<return submission of user>>=
if isinstance(user, User):
  uid = user.id
elif isinstance(user, int):
  uid = user
else:
  raise TypeError(f"user must be User or int")

if "include" in kwargs:
  to_include = set(kwargs["include"])
else:
  to_include = set()

# Check cache
if uid in self.__cache:
  lazy_submission = self.__cache[uid]
  # Get current includes from the wrapper
  current_includes = set(lazy_submission._includes)

  # If new includes are requested, merge and refetch
  if not to_include.issubset(current_includes):
    to_include |= current_includes
    raw_submission = get_submission(self, user, include=list(to_include))
    lazy_submission = LazySubmission(raw_submission, self, to_include,
                                     original_get_submission)
    self.__cache[uid] = lazy_submission

  return lazy_submission
else:
  # Not in cache, fetch and wrap
  raw_submission = get_submission(self, user, include=list(to_include))
  lazy_submission = LazySubmission(raw_submission, self, to_include,
                                   original_get_submission)
  self.__cache[uid] = lazy_submission
  return lazy_submission
@

Now we can deal with [[get_submissions]].
As we might call [[get_submission]] before any [[get_submissions]], we cannot
rely on the cache as a check.
We introduce a new attribute, initialized to [[None]] to indicate that no bulk
fetch has been performed yet.
This follows the same pattern as [[CacheGetMethods]], which uses [[None]] for
\enquote{not fetched} and [[datetime.now()]] for \enquote{last fetch time}.
<<extend class constructor for decorators>>=
args[0].__all_fetched = None
@ Now we can check if this is set or not.
When we fetch, we want to include any data that was previously included.

With lazy loading, we simplify the logic significantly.
We no longer check each submission for staleness here---the [[LazySubmission]]
wrapper handles that when attributes are accessed.
We only refetch all if we haven't fetched before, or if new includes are
requested that aren't in the cache.
