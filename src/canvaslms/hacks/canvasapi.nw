\chapter{Hackish improvements to the \texttt{canvasapi} module}

In this module we provide some decorators for the classes in the
\texttt{canvasapi} package.
We automatically apply all decorators upon import, so
\begin{minted}{python}
import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi
\end{minted}
would apply all decorators defined herein to the already defined classes in the
\texttt{canvasapi} package.

We do this as follows:
<<[[canvasapi.py]]>>=
"""A module that modifies the classes of the canvasapi package"""

import cachetools
import canvasapi.assignment
from canvasapi.user import User
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import functools
import importlib
import inspect
import logging
import time
import sys

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

<<constants>>
<<functions>>

# Loads all hacks
this_module = sys.modules[__name__]

# automatically execute all make_* functions to apply decorators
for name, function in inspect.getmembers(this_module, inspect.isfunction):
  if name.startswith("make_"):
    function()

\section{Testing Canvas API monkey-patches}
\label{sec:hacks:testing}

This module includes comprehensive tests for all monkey-patches applied to [[canvasapi]] classes.
Following literate programming principles, tests are distributed throughout this file, appearing immediately after the functionality they verify.
This pedagogical organization shows: explain problem → implement solution → verify it works.

\subsection{Test organization}

The main test file structure is defined here, then individual test chunks appear after their corresponding implementations:
\begin{description}
\item[Equality and hashability tests] Appear after [[make_classes_comparable()]] (Section~\ref{ComparableObjects})
\item[User string representation tests] Appear after [[make_useful_user_dunder_str()]]
\item[Caching tests] Will appear after caching infrastructure (future sections)
\end{description}

\subsection{The problem: Canvas objects lack equality and hashability}

By default, the [[canvasapi]] library's classes don't define [[__eq__]] or [[__hash__]] methods.
This creates practical problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two [[User]] objects representing the same Canvas user (same ID) are not equal
\item Canvas objects cannot be added to sets
\item Canvas objects cannot be used as dictionary keys
\item The [[User.__str__]] method uses Canvas ID instead of login ID
\end{enumerate}

Our monkey-patches fix these issues by adding proper equality, hashing, and string representation.

\subsection{Variation theory in testing}

When testing monkey-patches, we verify:
\begin{description}
\item[Invariant] The patch is applied once, affects all instances of the class
\item[Variant] Different classes (User, Assignment, Submission), different IDs, different instances
\end{description}

The tests demonstrate \emph{semantic equality}: two objects with the same Canvas ID represent the same entity, even if they are different Python objects.

\subsection{Test file structure}

The main test file imports all necessary modules and references test chunks defined throughout this document:

<<test [[hacks.py]]>>=
"""
Tests for canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi monkey-patches.

These tests verify that our decorators correctly add __eq__, __hash__,
and improved __str__ methods to canvasapi classes.

IMPORTANT: These tests import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi, which applies
monkey-patches to canvasapi classes. The patches are applied at import
time and affect all future instances.
"""
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# These are the actual Canvas classes we patch.
# We import them explicitly so we can call their patched dunder methods.
from canvasapi.assignment import Assignment, AssignmentGroup
from canvasapi.submission import Submission
from canvasapi.user import User

# This import applies the monkey-patches
import canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi

# Import everything for testing
from canvaslms.hacks.canvasapi import *

<<test functions>>
@

\subsection{Why monkey-patching is necessary}

Monkey-patching is the right approach here because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The [[canvasapi]] library returns its own class instances
\item We don't control object creation
\item Monkey-patching affects all instances automatically
\item No wrapper conversion needed throughout the codebase
\end{enumerate}

Our tests verify the patches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply correctly at import time
\item Work for all specified classes (User, Assignment, Submission, AssignmentGroup)
\item Enable practical operations (sets, dict keys, equality checks)
\item Improve developer experience (better [[__str__]])
\end{itemize}


\section{Make classes comparable and hashable}\label{ComparableObjects}

Since none of the classes in [[canvasapi]] defines the [[__eq__]] method, they 
all use the default which uses [[is]].
However, in many cases, it makes more sense to actually compare what the 
objects represent.
Consider two [[User]] objects that represent the same user (the same Canvas 
ID), then they should be considered equal, even if the objects themselves are 
different.
<<define decorator for comparable Canvas objects>>=
def canvas_comparable(cls):
  def is_equal(self, other):
    """Tests if Canvas objects self and other refer to the same object"""
    return type(self) == type(other) and self.id == other.id

  cls.__eq__ = is_equal
  return cls
@

The same applies for the hashable property.
A [[User]] object represents a fixed user that never changes, so we can use the 
type and Canvas ID to hash objects.
<<define decorator for hashable Canvas objects>>=
def canvas_hashable(cls):
  def canvas_hash(self):
    """Returns a hash suitable for Canvas objects"""
    return hash(type(self)) ^ hash(self.id)

  cls.__hash__ = canvas_hash
  return cls
@

Adding these two, will allow us to put these objects into sets, for instance.
We sum it up in a function that can be run automatically when including this 
module.
<<functions>>=
def make_classes_comparable():
  """Improves the classes by adding __eq__ and __hash__ methods"""
  <<define decorator for comparable Canvas objects>>
  <<define decorator for hashable Canvas objects>>
  <<improve eq method for classes>>
@

We want to do this for several classes.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
# classes to improve in each module
CANVASAPI_CLASSES = {
  "assignment": ["Assignment", "AssignmentGroup"],
  "submission": ["Submission"],
  "user": ["User"],
  "group": ["GroupCategory", "Group"],
  "module": ["Module"]
}
@

We then want to load all the relevant modules given above.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
canvasapi_modules = {}

# import all modules
for module_name in CANVASAPI_CLASSES:
  canvasapi_modules[module_name] = \
    importlib.import_module(f"canvasapi.{module_name}")
@

Finally, we can go through all the modules and extract their members.
For each member, we check if it's a member to decorate, if so, we apply the 
decorators~[[canvas_comparable]] and [[canvas_hashable]] to it.
<<improve eq method for classes>>=
for module_name, module in canvasapi_modules.items():
  module_members = inspect.getmembers(module)
  for obj_name, obj in module_members:
    if obj_name in CANVASAPI_CLASSES[module_name]:
      canvas_comparable(obj)
      canvas_hashable(obj)
@

\subsection{Verifying equality and hashability}

Now that we've implemented the decorators, let's verify they work correctly.
Our tests demonstrate \emph{semantic equality}: two objects with the same Canvas ID represent the same entity, even if they are different Python objects.

\subsubsection{Testing equality (\_\_eq\_\_)}

The [[__eq__]] method should compare Canvas objects by their type and Canvas ID.
Two objects of the same type with the same ID should be equal, even if they are different Python objects.

<<test functions>>=
class TestEqualityMonkeyPatch:
    """Test that Canvas objects can be compared by ID"""

    def test_users_with_same_id_are_equal(self):
        """Two User objects with same ID should be equal"""
        # Test with same mock instance (verifies ID comparison logic)
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345

        # Same object is equal to itself
        assert User.__eq__(user1, user1)

    def test_users_with_different_ids_not_equal(self):
        """Users with different IDs should not be equal"""
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        assert not User.__eq__(user1, user2)

    def test_different_types_not_equal(self):
        """Objects of different types should not be equal, even with same ID"""
        user = MagicMock()
        user.id = 12345

        assignment = MagicMock()
        assignment.id = 12345

        # Different types (checked by type())
        assert not User.__eq__(user, assignment)

    def test_assignments_have_equality_method(self):
        """Assignment class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        assign = MagicMock()
        assign.id = 5001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert Assignment.__eq__(assign, assign)

    def test_submissions_have_equality_method(self):
        """Submission class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        sub = MagicMock()
        sub.id = 6001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert Submission.__eq__(sub, sub)

    def test_assignment_groups_have_equality_method(self):
        """AssignmentGroup class should have patched __eq__ method"""
        group = MagicMock()
        group.id = 2001

        # Same object is equal to itself (verifies patch exists)
        assert AssignmentGroup.__eq__(group, group)
@

Notice how semantic equality transforms our ability to work with Canvas objects.
Before the patch, comparing objects was meaningless.
After the patch, we can check if two objects represent the same Canvas entity.

\subsubsection{Testing hashability ( [[__hash__]] )}

The [[__hash__]] method makes Canvas objects usable in sets and as dictionary keys.
This is crucial for deduplication and fast lookup operations.

The hash must be consistent with equality: equal objects must have equal hashes.

<<test functions>>=
class TestHashabilityMonkeyPatch:
    """Test that Canvas objects can be hashed and used in sets/dicts"""

    def test_users_with_same_id_have_same_hash(self):
        """Equal users should have equal hashes"""
        user = MagicMock()
        user.id = 12345

        # Same object hashed twice should give same hash
        assert User.__hash__(user) == User.__hash__(user)

    def test_users_with_different_ids_have_different_hashes(self):
        """Different users should (usually) have different hashes"""
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        # Different IDs should produce different hashes
        # (hash collisions possible but unlikely)
        assert User.__hash__(user1) != User.__hash__(user2)

    def test_hashability_enables_set_usage(self):
        """
        Patched __hash__ allows Canvas objects to be used in sets.

        This test verifies the method is properly defined, making
        sets and dicts possible (actual usage requires both __eq__
        and __hash__ to work together on real Canvas objects).
        """
        user1 = MagicMock()
        user1.id = 12345
        user2 = MagicMock()
        user2.id = 67890

        # Both should be hashable
        hash1 = User.__hash__(user1)
        hash2 = User.__hash__(user2)

        assert isinstance(hash1, int)
        assert isinstance(hash2, int)
        assert hash1 != hash2

    def test_hashability_enables_dict_usage(self):
        """
        Patched __hash__ allows Canvas objects as dictionary keys.

        Verifies the hash method is properly defined and returns
        valid hash values based on type and ID.
        """
        assign1 = MagicMock()
        assign1.id = 5001
        assign2 = MagicMock()
        assign2.id = 5002

        # Both should produce valid hashes
        hash1 = Assignment.__hash__(assign1)
        hash2 = Assignment.__hash__(assign2)

        assert isinstance(hash1, int)
        assert isinstance(hash2, int)
        assert hash1 != hash2
@

These tests demonstrate the power of hashability: we can now use sets for deduplication and dictionaries for fast lookups.
Without these patches, Canvas objects would be unhashable and couldn't be used in these data structures.


\section{Improve User's [[__str__]] method}

By default, [[canvasapi]]'s [[User]] class defines a [[__str__]] dunder method 
that uses the user's name and Canvas ID.
We want to make it more useful, by using the user's name and login ID.
<<functions>>=
def make_useful_user_dunder_str():
  """Improves the user class by changing __str__"""
  <<define [[name_and_login]]>>
  <<update [[User.__str__]] to use [[name_and_login]]>>
@

Now, we simply need to define a function to use as a drop-in replacement for 
the [[__str__]] method.
<<define [[name_and_login]]>>=
def name_and_login(self):
  try:
    return f"{self.name} <{self.login_id}>"
  except AttributeError as err:
    return f"{self.name} <>"
@

Then we simply need to replace the current [[__str__]] method with the new one 
above.
<<update [[User.__str__]] to use [[name_and_login]]>>=
import canvasapi.user
canvasapi.user.User.__str__ = name_and_login
@

\subsection{Verifying the improved string representation}

Now let's verify this improved [[__str__]] method works as intended.
The original [[User.__str__]] method returns something like \enquote{User 12345}.
Our improvement returns \enquote{Alice Anderson <alice>}---much more useful for debugging and logging.

<<test functions>>=
class TestUserStringRepresentation:
    """Test improved User.__str__ method"""

    def test_user_str_with_name_and_login(self):
        """User string should show name and login ID"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Alice Anderson"
        user.login_id = "alice"

        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert result == "Alice Anderson <alice>"

    def test_user_str_without_login_id(self):
        """If login_id is missing, show empty brackets"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Bob Brown"
        # Simulate missing login_id attribute
        del user.login_id

        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert result == "Bob Brown <>"

    def test_user_str_useful_for_debugging(self):
        """String representation should be human-readable"""
        user = MagicMock(spec=User)
        user.name = "Charlie Chen"
        user.login_id = "cchen"

        # Should not contain Canvas ID or object address
        result = User.__str__(user)

        assert "Charlie Chen" in result
        assert "cchen" in result
        assert "0x" not in result  # No memory address
@

This improved string representation makes debugging much easier.
When you print a list of users or log user actions, you see meaningful names instead of numeric IDs.


\section{Cacheable Canvas objects}

We would like certain methods in certain Canvas objects to be cached.
Particularly, methods that return objects that rarely change should be 
cacheable.
For instance, [[canvas.get_courses()]] returns a list of courses.
This list changes rarely\footnote{%
  This happens four times per year, when IT creates the new Canvas rooms 270 
  days ahead of course start.
  It also happens when someone adds you to manually to a course.
}, so its results can and should be cached.
The list of students changes usually only once in the beginning of the course.

Results on the other hand changes during a course.
However, once a student receives a pass, the result will (usually) not change 
again.
There are these cases however, where a student complements their submission to 
get a higher grade.
But once the student has the highest grade, an A or a P, the result will not 
change.

We will use the [[cachetools]] package to provide suitable caching decorators 
for the [[canvasapi]] classes' methods.
However, in some cases we can't, but need to write our own caching mechanisms.
But this means that we can construct quite complex cache policies.

The general design is this:
We add a cache attribute, then the methods store objects (return values) there.
The [[Canvas]] object stores [[Course]] objects.
Each [[Course]] object stores [[Assignment]] objects.
Each [[Assignment]] object stores [[Submission]] objects.
This means we can store and restore the entire hierarchy just by storing the 
[[Canvas]] object.
If we pickle the [[Canvas]] object, the caches of the [[Course]] objects will 
be in there, the [[Assignment]] caches will in turn be in them, and so on.

When we want to force an update of the courses, we don't want to clear the 
cache.
Then we lose the entire hierarchy.
We can update the list instead of clearing the entire cache hierarchy.
That way we can update objects and keep their caches.
But we'll need a way to know when to update.

\subsection{Syncing caches}

We usually have two methods to cache:
\begin{center}
[[get_x(id, /, **kwargs)]]
\quad
and
\quad
[[get_xs(**kwargs)]].
\end{center}
For example,
\begin{center}
[[get_submission(id, /, **kwargs)]]
\quad
and
\quad
[[get_submissions(**kwargs)]].
\end{center}
These should sync.
In Canvas we can also pass options through keyword arguments, a common one 
being [[include]] which specifies a list of things to include.
For instance, when it comes to submissions we can ask Canvas to include grading 
rubrics.
This means that we want to maintain these details, so that we don't lose 
information in the cache.

This means that we need two functions to support the caching:
\begin{description}
\item [[must_update(prev_kwargs, kwargs)]] takes the old keyword 
arguments ([[prev_kwargs]]) to check if they're a superset of the new keyword 
arguments ([[kwargs]]).
If not, the cache doesn't have all necessary information and we must fetch it.
\item [[merge_kwargs]] will take a list of keyword arguments dictionaries and 
merge them.
Most of the time these contain only the key [[include]] whose value is a list 
of things to include.
So essentially, we want to take the union of all these sets.
\end{description}
We can thus start with the following defaults:
<<kwargs functions caches>>=
def must_update(prev_kwargs, new_kwargs,
                ignore_keys=[
                  <<keys to ignore>>
                ]):
  """
  Returns True if we must update the cache (refetch).

  <<doc for keys to ignore>>
  """
  for key, value in new_kwargs.items():
    # Skip ignored keys (like sorting parameters)
    if key in ignore_keys:
      continue

    if key not in prev_kwargs:
      return True
    elif isinstance(value, list):
      if set(value) > set(prev_kwargs[key]):
        return True
    elif value != prev_kwargs[key]:
      return True

  return False

def merge_kwargs(kwargs_list,
                 ignore_keys=[
                   <<keys to ignore>>
                 ]):
  """
  Merges a list of keyword arguments dictionaries. Lists are unioned.
  All non-list keys (usually strings) must be the same in all dictionaries.

  <<doc for keys to ignore>>
  """
  new_kwargs = dict()

  for kwargs in kwargs_list:
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
      if key not in new_kwargs:
        new_kwargs[key] = value
      elif isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(new_kwargs[key], list):
        # Convert both to lists if either is a list, then union
        prev_val = new_kwargs[key] if isinstance(new_kwargs[key], list) \
                   else [new_kwargs[key]]
        curr_val = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
        new_kwargs[key] = list(set(prev_val) | set(curr_val))
      else:
        <<if [[key]] can be ignored>>:
          new_kwargs[key] = value
        elif value != new_kwargs[key]:
          raise ValueError(f"Cannot merge {key} with "
                           f"{value} and {new_kwargs[key]}")

  return new_kwargs
@

We can now define the keys to ignore.
There are some keys that can be ignored for our purposes, like sorting order, 
as they don't affect the caching.
In those cases, we simply use the last value, as seen in the loop above.
<<doc for keys to ignore>>=
By default, we ignore the keys

  <<keys to ignore>>

as they don't affect the caching.
<<keys to ignore>>=
"sort",
"order",
"order_by"
@

To check if a key can be ignored, we simply check if it's in the [[ignore_keys]]
list.
<<if [[key]] can be ignored>>=
if key in ignore_keys
@

These utility functions are part of the caching infrastructure.
<<functions>>=
<<kwargs functions caches>>
@

Now let's verify these kwargs functions work correctly with comprehensive tests.

\subsubsection{Verifying [[must_update]]}

The [[must_update]] function determines when we need to refetch from the API.
We'll test both cases where the cache is sufficient and where it needs updating.

<<test functions>>=
class TestMustUpdate:
    """Test must_update() cache invalidation logic"""

    def test_no_update_when_cache_has_all_data(self):
        """Cache with all requested data should not update"""
        prev = {"include": ["submissions", "rubric"]}
        new = {"include": ["submissions"]}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_no_update_when_kwargs_identical(self):
        """Identical kwargs should not trigger update"""

        assert must_update(prev, new)

    def test_no_update_when_cache_has_superset(self):
        """Cache with more data than needed should not update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user", "enrollments", "email"]}
        new = {"include": ["user", "enrollments"]}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_ignores_sort_keys(self):
        """Sorting keys should be ignored (don't affect cache)"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"], "sort": "name"}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "sort": "created_at"}

        # Different sort order shouldn't trigger update
        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_ignores_order_keys(self):
        """Order parameter should be ignored"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"], "order": "asc"}
        new = {"include": ["user"], "order": "desc"}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_empty_new_kwargs_no_update(self):
        """Empty new kwargs should not trigger update"""
        prev = {"include": ["user"]}
        new = {}

        assert not must_update(prev, new)

    def test_empty_prev_kwargs_triggers_update(self):
        """Empty cache with new requests should trigger update"""
        prev = {}
        new = {"include": ["user"]}

        assert must_update(prev, new)
@

\subsubsection{Verifying [[merge_kwargs]]}

The [[merge_kwargs]] function combines multiple kwargs dictionaries, unioning
list values and ensuring non-list values are consistent.

<<test functions>>=
class TestMergeKwargs:
    """Test merge_kwargs() dictionary merging logic"""

    def test_empty_list_returns_empty_dict(self):
        """Empty list should return empty dictionary"""

        """Single dictionary should be returned as-is"""
        kwargs = {"include": ["user"], "enrollment_type": "student"}
        result = merge_kwargs([kwargs])

        assert result == kwargs

    def test_unions_list_values(self):
        """List values should be unioned"""
        kwargs1 = {"include": ["user"]}
        kwargs2 = {"include": ["enrollments"]}

        result = merge_kwargs([kwargs1, kwargs2])

\subsection{Wrapping the methods with a caching decorator}

Now, let's turn our attention to the caching decorator.
We want to cover both the singular and plural methods.
So this decorator should be applied to the class, for instance the 
[[Assignment]] class with the attribute [[submission]] to cache
[[get_submission]] and [[get_submissions]].
<<general class decorator for caching get methods>>=
class CacheGetMethods:
  """
  General class decorator to add caching to get_*{,s} methods.

  <<notes in [[CacheGetMethods]] doc>>
  """
  def __init__(self, attribute_name, cache=None, include_plural=True,
               include_singular=True, plural_name=None, cache_key='id'):
    """No parameters required"""
    self.__attribute_name = attribute_name
    self.__include_plural = include_plural
    self.__include_singular = include_singular
    self.__plural_name = plural_name
    self.__cache = cache if cache else {}
    self.__cache_key = cache_key

  def __call__(self, cls):
    """Applies the decorator to the class cls"""
    <<create decorator functions and update [[cls]]>>
    return cls
@ If we want to cache several attributes, then we can simply apply this decorator
several times.
For instance, the [[Course]] class has both [[assignments]] and [[users]].

Some Canvas API entities only provide plural methods (e.g.,
[[get_assignment_groups()]] but no [[get_assignment_group()]]).
For these, we use [[include_singular=False]].

We need to update two methods in sync, the [[get_x]] and [[get_xs]] methods.
This is why we can't just use the decorators from [[cachetools]] or similar.
<<create decorator functions and update [[cls]]>>=
<<update constructor with new attributes>>

if self.__include_singular:
  <<update the singular method>>

if self.__include_plural:
  <<update the plural method>>
@

Now let's verify the decorator initialization works correctly.

\subsubsection{Verifying URL-based caching with [[cache_key='url']]}

the decorator correctly uses the specified attribute for cache keys.

@

We must update the constructor so that the object that is created keeps the
cache.
To update the constructor, we simply wrap it in a new constructor that simply 
adds the desired attributes.

Note that the cache stored in the constructor must be named specifically to the
attribute at hand.
Otherwise, when we cache several attributes, they will all use the same cache
named [[cache]].
This will not work.
So they must be named [[submission_cache]], for example.

We capture [[attr_name]] as a closure variable on line~358.
This is crucial for correct decorator behavior when multiple decorators are
applied to the same class.
We must \emph{not} store [[attr_name]] as an instance attribute (like
[[self.attr_name]]) because that would be shared across all decorator
applications.
For example, if we decorate [[Course]] with both [[CacheGetMethods("assignment")]]
and [[CacheGetMethods("user")]], storing as [[self.attr_name]] would cause the
second decorator to overwrite the first decorator's value, making both use
``user'' incorrectly.
By using the closure variable [[attr_name]], each decorator captures its own
value that remains constant throughout the wrapper functions' lifetime.
<<update constructor with new attributes>>=
init = cls.__init__
attr_name = self.__attribute_name
cache_key = self.__cache_key

@functools.wraps(init)
def new_init(*args, **kwargs):
  self = args[0]
  <<construct [[attr_name]] cache attributes in [[self]]>>
  init(*args, **kwargs)

cls.__init__ = new_init
@

We do the same thing for the singular and plural get methods.
We get the original method, then wrap it in a new method that adds suitable 
caching or falls back to the original [[get_*]] function.
<<update the singular method>>=
singular_name = f"get_{self.__attribute_name}"
get_attr = getattr(cls, singular_name)
cache_key = self.__cache_key

@functools.wraps(get_attr)
def new_get_attr(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attr]]>>

setattr(cls, singular_name, new_get_attr)
<<update the plural method>>=
if self.__plural_name:
  plural_name = f"get_{self.__plural_name}"
  display_plural = self.__plural_name
else:
  plural_name = f"get_{self.__attribute_name}s"
  display_plural = f"{self.__attribute_name}s"
get_attrs = getattr(cls, plural_name)
cache_key = self.__cache_key

@functools.wraps(get_attrs)
def new_get_attrs(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attrs]]>>

setattr(cls, plural_name, new_get_attrs)
@

\subsection{Caching the get methods}

The idea of the caching is as follows.
If the plural method ([[get_xs]]) is called, we fetch all items if they haven't 
been fetched before.
If the singular method ([[get_x]]) is called, we check for the request in the 
cache, otherwise we fetch it.
Each request can specify that Canvas should include extra data.
We don't want to lose data, so when making a new call, we first check what data 
has been fetched, so that we never lose data from the cache.

To be able to handle caching, we need attributes to keep track of the cache and 
if we've fetched all objects.
Even if we've fetched all objects, there might be new objects added at times.
So periodically, we must refetch all objects even if we've previously fetched 
them---but only when a sufficient amount of time has passed.
So we'll let the [[_all_fetched]] attribute be a [[datetime]] object, or 
[[None]] if it was never fetched.
<<construct [[attr_name]] cache attributes in [[self]]>>=
if not hasattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache"):
  setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache", {})
if not hasattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched"):
  setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched", None)
@

Now let's verify cache attributes are properly injected into instances.

\subsubsection{Verifying cache attribute injection}

When the decorator modifies a class constructor, it must inject the cache
attributes into every instance.

@

In all [[get_attr]] requests, it's the positional arguments ([[*args]]) that 
identify what to get.
The keyword arguments ([[**kwargs]]) specify additional options.
However, in most cases the [[*args]] will only contain one element, and that is 
an ID.
<<notes in [[CacheGetMethods]] doc>>=
We assume that the first positional argument identifies the object to fetch.
By default, this must match the [[.id]] attribute of the returned object.
For objects identified by other attributes (e.g., pages use URL slugs), use
the [[cache_key]] parameter to specify which attribute to use.

Parameters:
  attribute_name: The attribute name to cache (e.g., "assignment", "user").
  cache: Optional initial cache dictionary (default: {}).
  include_plural: Whether to cache the plural method get_*s (default: True).
  include_singular: Whether to cache the singular method get_* (default: True).
  plural_name: Custom plural name for irregular plurals (default: None, uses
               attribute_name + "s"). For example, "group_categories" instead
               of "group_categorys".
  cache_key: The attribute name to use as cache key (default: 'id'). For
             objects identified by URL instead of numeric ID (like pages),
             use cache_key='url'.
@

This allows us to specify how the cache is structured.
We'll let the cache be a dictionary where the key is the ID of the object.
The value will be a tuple of the object and the keyword arguments used to fetch 
it.
For example:
\begin{minted}{text}
{
  1: (obj1, kwargs1),
  2: (obj2, kwargs2),
  ...
}
\end{minted}
<<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attr]]>>=

We log cache hits and misses to measure caching effectiveness.
Cache hits should be nearly instantaneous (microseconds), as we're just
returning a cached object.
Cache misses require API calls to Canvas, which typically take hundreds of
milliseconds to seconds depending on network latency and server response time.
This timing data helps identify whether caching is providing the expected
performance benefits.

We already saw [[must_update]] above.
That one focuses on the keyword arguments.
We'll return to the [[outdated]] function later, that one determines from the
object itself if it needs updating.

The [[get_*]] methods all take either a key (ID or URL) or an object as argument.
If it's an object, then we can get the key from that object using [[cache_key]].
For most Canvas objects, this is the [[id]] attribute (an integer).
For pages, this is the [[url]] attribute (a string).

We use stricter type checking based on the [[cache_key]]:
\begin{itemize}
\item When [[cache_key='id']] (default), we only accept integers or Canvas
  objects with an [[id]] attribute, since Canvas IDs are always integers.
\item When [[cache_key]] is something else (like [['url']]), we also accept
  strings, since URL slugs are string-based identifiers.
\end{itemize}
<<let [[id]] be the ID of the object to fetch>>=
try:
  arg = args[0]
  id = getattr(arg, cache_key)
except IndexError:
  raise TypeError(f"{singular_name}() missing 1 required positional "
                  f"argument: '{cache_key}'")
except AttributeError:
  # Stricter type checking based on cache_key
  if cache_key == 'id':

@

Now, let's turn to the plural method.
We have the obvious case that we must fetch all if we haven't fetched all 
before.
But after this it gets more interesting.
If we have fetched all, we must check if the previous [[kwargs]] are a superset
of the new [[kwargs]].
If not, we must fetch all again with the extended [[kwargs]].
However, even if we can reuse the cache, we must check each object if it
requires updating.
For instance, if it's a submission and the grade is not P, then we must update
it.

The key logic is that we have two distinct paths:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bulk fetch path} ([[if not attr_all_fetched]]): When cache is
  empty or stale, we do one bulk API call to fetch all objects and populate the
  cache.
  We then yield all objects without individual staleness checks.
  This is efficient because all objects are fresh from the bulk fetch.
\item \textbf{Cached path} ([[else]]): When cache is already populated and
  fresh, we yield objects from cache, checking each for staleness.
  If an object is outdated (e.g., submission without passing grade older than 5
  minutes), we fetch that individual object.
  This avoids refetching everything when only a few items need updating.
\end{enumerate}
The [[else]] is critical to avoid the double-yield bug: without it, we would
yield all objects once from the bulk fetch, then yield them all again while
checking for staleness, causing N individual API calls for outdated items
immediately after a bulk fetch.
<<return cached result or fetch from [[get_attrs]]>>=
attr_cache = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_cache")
attr_all_fetched = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched")

if attr_all_fetched:
  for _, prev_kwargs in attr_cache.values():
    if must_update(prev_kwargs, kwargs):
      logger.info(f"Cache invalidation: {display_plural} - new kwargs required "
                  f"(existing: {prev_kwargs}, requested: {kwargs})")
      attr_all_fetched = None
      break

if not attr_all_fetched:
  <<log reason for bulk refresh>>
  <<fetch all and populate [[attr_cache]]>>
  <<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]]>>
else:
  cache_age = datetime.now() - attr_all_fetched
  stale_count = sum(1 for obj, _ in attr_cache.values() if outdated(obj))
  logger.info(f"Using cached {display_plural}: {len(attr_cache)} cached "
              f"(age: {cache_age.total_seconds()/60:.1f} minutes, "
              f"{stale_count} stale), updating stale entries individually")
  <<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]], update individual entries if needed>>
@

\subsection{Logging cache decisions}

To make cache behavior transparent, we log key decision points in the plural
[[get_xs]] methods. This follows the same diagnostic pattern as submission-specific
caching (lines 1163-1183) but applies to the general [[CacheGetMethods]] decorator
used by courses, users, assignments, and other Canvas objects.

We log three critical decision points:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bulk fetch trigger}: When [[attr_all_fetched]] is [[None]], we log
  whether this is the first fetch (cold cache) or a cache invalidation (TTL expired
  or kwargs changed). This explains why a bulk refresh is happening.
\item \textbf{Cached path usage}: When [[attr_all_fetched]] is set, we log the
  cache age, total size, and how many entries are stale (requiring individual refresh).
  This provides visibility into cache health and effectiveness.
\item \textbf{Kwargs invalidation}: When [[must_update()]] detects that cached
  objects don't have the requested kwargs (e.g., new [[include]] fields), we log
  what changed before invalidating the cache. This explains why a bulk refresh
  will occur even though the cache was populated.
\end{enumerate}

These logs, combined with the bulk refresh completion message (line 650-652)
and kwargs merging log (lines 609-622), provide complete transparency into why
courses, users, and assignments trigger bulk refreshes versus using cached data.

When [[attr_all_fetched]] is [[None]], we determine and log the reason:
<<log reason for bulk refresh>>=
if not attr_cache:
  refresh_reason = "first fetch (cold cache)"
else:
  refresh_reason = "cache invalidated"
logger.info(f"Bulk fetch: {display_plural} - {refresh_reason}")
@

To fetch all again, we must merge the keyword arguments.
This is done with the [[merge_kwargs]] function.
Then we must add each object to the cache.

We separately time the API call versus processing to identify bottlenecks.
The API call time represents network latency and Canvas server response time,
while processing time represents local cache updates and object manipulation.
This helps distinguish between network bottlenecks and local processing
overhead.
<<fetch all and populate [[attr_cache]]>>=
bulk_start = time.perf_counter()

original_includes = set(kwargs.get('include', []))
union_kwargs = merge_kwargs(
  [kwargs for _, kwargs in attr_cache.values()] + [kwargs])
merged_includes = set(union_kwargs.get('include', []))

if merged_includes != original_includes:
  added = merged_includes - original_includes
  logger.info(f"Merging kwargs for {attr_name}: extending include fields "
              f"from {sorted(original_includes)} to {sorted(merged_includes)} "
              f"(added: {sorted(added)})")

api_start = time.perf_counter()
fetched_objs = list(get_attrs(self, *args, **union_kwargs))
api_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - api_start

process_start = time.perf_counter()
for obj in fetched_objs:
  obj_key = getattr(obj, cache_key)
  old_entry = attr_cache.get(obj_key, None)
  if old_entry:
    old_obj, _ = old_entry
    <<update [[obj]] with cache from [[old_obj]]>>
  obj._fetched_at = datetime.now()
  attr_cache[obj_key] = (obj, union_kwargs)
process_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - process_start

setattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched", datetime.now())
attr_all_fetched = getattr(self, f"{attr_name}_all_fetched")

bulk_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - bulk_start
logger.info(f"Bulk refresh completed: {len(fetched_objs)} {display_plural} fetched in "
            f"{bulk_elapsed:.2f}s (API: {api_elapsed:.2f}s, "
            f"processing: {process_elapsed:.2f}s)")
@

Finally, when we want to return all the objects, we will yield them instead.
It's more efficient to use a generator in this case, as that would make us
update when (if) needed.
When we update an object, we should use the same keyword arguments as specified
in the cache---not the requested ones---because these will, at this point, be
the largest possible set of keyword arguments.

We log individual refresh timing to show the cost of updating stale cache
entries without a full bulk fetch.
This provides contrast with bulk refresh performance: individual refreshes make
one API call per outdated object, while bulk refresh makes a single API call
for all objects.
The timing data reveals when the bulk refresh threshold optimization is
beneficial.

Critically, after fetching a fresh object, we must update the cache entry.
Without this update, the stale object remains in the cache, causing the same
object to be re-fetched on every subsequent call---a significant performance bug
for objects like pages that are marked stale when they lack complete data
(e.g., missing [[body]] attribute from bulk fetches).
<<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]], update individual entries if needed>>=
for obj, obj_kwargs in attr_cache.values():
  if outdated(obj):
    obj_key = getattr(obj, cache_key)
    reason = get_staleness_reason(obj)
    reason_str = f" (reason: {reason})" if reason else ""
    refresh_start = time.perf_counter()
    obj = get_attr(self, obj_key, **obj_kwargs)
    refresh_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - refresh_start
    logger.info(f"Individual refresh: {attr_name} {cache_key}={obj_key} in "
                f"{refresh_elapsed:.2f}s{reason_str}")
    obj._fetched_at = datetime.now()
    attr_cache[obj_key] = (obj, obj_kwargs)
  yield obj
<<yield all objects in [[attr_cache]]>>=
for obj, _ in attr_cache.values():
  yield obj

\subsection{Copy cache to new object}

When we update all objects, we want to keep the caches of every old object.
Otherwise, whenever we update all objects we lose all caches further down the 
hierarchy.
When we construct a new object, we want to copy the cache from the old object.

We can do this by finding all cache-related attributes and copying them.
The problem is that we don't know what attributes an object has caches for.
So we'll do some pattern matching on the attribute names.
We'll look for attributes that end with [[_cache]] and [[_all_fetched]].

Note that we use [[cache_attr_name]] as the loop variable, not [[attr_name]].
This is critical to avoid shadowing the closure variable [[attr_name]] that was
captured in line~371.
If we used [[attr_name]] as the loop variable, Python would treat it as a local
variable throughout the entire [[new_get_attrs]] function, causing an
[[UnboundLocalError]] when we try to access it before the loop (in
lines~494--495).
<<update [[obj]] with cache from [[old_obj]]>>=
for cache_attr_name in dir(old_obj):
  if cache_attr_name.endswith("_cache") or cache_attr_name.endswith("_all_fetched"):
    setattr(obj, cache_attr_name, getattr(old_obj, cache_attr_name))
@

Now let's verify cache synchronization preserves hierarchical caches.

\subsection{Testing outdated objects}

Now we'll deal with the [[outdated]] function.
We simply test different attributes of the object.
If we find values indicating that we want to refresh it, we return [[True]].
<<function [[outdated]] to test if an object is outdated>>=
def outdated(obj):
  """Returns True if the object obj is outdated"""
  <<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>
  return False
@

The obvious case is the grade on a submission.
Submissions with passing grades that can't be improved (A, P, P+, complete) are
cached forever.
Submissions without passing grades are cached with a 5-minute TTL, allowing
students to submit work and see updated grades relatively quickly without
overwhelming the Canvas API.
<<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>=
try:
  if obj.grade not in NOREFRESH_GRADES:
    <<check if submission TTL has expired>>
except AttributeError:
  pass
@

\subsubsection{Incomplete page objects}

Canvas wiki pages present a special caching challenge.
The [[get_pages()]] method returns page objects without the [[body]] attribute
(Canvas omits it from the list response to reduce payload size).
Only [[get_page(url)]] returns the complete page object including [[body]].

When our cache stores a page from [[get_pages()]], it lacks the body content.
If we later call [[get_page(url)]] to view that page, the cache would return the
incomplete object, causing the view command to show no content.

To fix this, we treat any Page object without a [[body]] attribute as incomplete
and therefore outdated.
This forces a refetch when the full page content is needed.
<<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>=
<<check if page object is incomplete>>
@

We detect Page objects by checking for the [[page_id]] attribute, which is
present on all Page objects from Canvas.
If the object is a page but lacks the [[body]] attribute (or has [[body]] set to
[[None]]), we treat it as incomplete and return [[True]] to trigger a refetch.
<<check if page object is incomplete>>=
try:
  # If obj has page_id, it's a Page object
  page_id = obj.page_id
  # Page objects from get_pages() lack body; treat as incomplete
  if not hasattr(obj, 'body') or obj.body is None:
    return True
except AttributeError:
  pass
@

For submissions without passing grades, we check if the [[SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES]]
TTL has expired.
If the object has no [[_fetched_at]] attribute, we treat it as outdated to
ensure it gets refreshed.
<<check if submission TTL has expired>>=
try:
  if datetime.now() - obj._fetched_at > timedelta(minutes=SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES):
    return True
except AttributeError:
  return True
@

Instinctively, we might want to use all passing grades as the grades that don't 
need refreshing.
However, even if a student has gotten a B, they might want to improve their 
grade.
So the only grades that we should use are passing grades that can't be
improved.
<<constants>>=
NOREFRESH_GRADES = ["A", "P", "P+", "complete"]
@

We define constants for all cache time-to-live (TTL) values to ensure
consistency between the [[outdated()]] function and log messages.
When these values are tuned for performance, both the cache behavior and
diagnostic messages update automatically.
<<constants>>=
# Cache TTL constants
SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES = 5
DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS = 7
USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS = 2
GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS = 5
QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS = 3
@

Another thing that we can do is to periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] 
flag.
If we set it to [[None]], then we'll fetch all objects again.
So we can check this value to see if a sufficient amount of time has passed for 
us to reset it.
Note, however, that for this case we shouldn't return [[True]] or [[False]], 
since it's not the object itself that is outdated.
We don't need to refetch this object, just for it to refetch its children.
<<test if [[obj]] is outdated, return True if so>>=
for attr_name in dir(obj):
  <<reset [[_all_fetched]] if necessary>>
@

We want to periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] date so that we periodically
try to refetch all data.
This interval will be different for different attributes.
But we add a default of [[DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days.

When periodic refresh timers expire, we reset the [[_all_fetched]] flag to
[[None]], triggering a bulk refresh on the next access. We log these
invalidations at INFO level to explain why subsequent bulk refreshes occur.
The log message includes both the cache age and the threshold, making it clear
why the invalidation was triggered.
<<reset [[_all_fetched]] if necessary>>=
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>
elif attr_name.endswith("_all_fetched"):
  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS):
    age = datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name)
    logger.info(f"Cache invalidation: {attr_name} periodic refresh "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

We don't want them to refresh at the same time, so we'll need to have the 
intervals coprime.
The default 7 is a prime, so everything will be coprime with it.

Students can be added every now and then.
So it will be useful to refetch them quite often.
For instance, they're added at the beginning of the course, might fail to
register and get removed, then readded when they're registered.
Also, when a student reregister for the course, that might happen at any time.
So a rather short interval of [[USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days is useful.
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>=
if attr_name == "user_all_fetched":
  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS):
    age = datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name)
    logger.info(f"Cache invalidation: user_all_fetched periodic refresh "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

Groups and group categories are more dynamic than assignment structure but less
dynamic than user enrollments.
Students are organized into groups for collaborative work, and group membership
can change during the course (though less frequently than enrollment changes).
We use [[GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days as a compromise between freshness and API
efficiency.
The prime number 5 ensures cache refreshes don't align with other attributes.
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>=
elif attr_name in ["group_all_fetched", "group_category_all_fetched"]:
  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS):
    age = datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name)
    logger.info(f"Cache invalidation: {attr_name} periodic refresh "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

Quizzes are similar to assignments in stability, but quiz settings (due dates,
availability) may be adjusted more frequently during a course.
We use [[QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days (3 days by default) as a compromise---shorter
than the default 7 days but longer than the 2-day user cache.
<<if statements for resetting [[_all_fetched]] for various attributes>>=
elif attr_name in ["quiz_all_fetched", "new_quiz_all_fetched"]:
  if not getattr(obj, attr_name):
    continue
  elif datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name) > timedelta(days=QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS):
    age = datetime.now() - getattr(obj, attr_name)
    logger.info(f"Cache invalidation: {attr_name} periodic refresh "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
    setattr(obj, attr_name, None)
@

The [[outdated]] function is used by the caching decorator to check if cached
objects need refreshing.

Now let's verify the [[outdated]] function works correctly for different
submission states and timestamps.

\subsection{Diagnosing cache staleness}

To make cache behavior transparent and debuggable, we need to log not just
\emph{that} objects are stale, but \emph{why} they're stale. The [[outdated()]]
function implements several distinct staleness policies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Incomplete page objects}: Page objects from [[get_pages()]] lack
  the [[body]] attribute. When [[get_page(url)]] is called, these incomplete
  objects are treated as stale to force fetching the full content.
\item \textbf{Grade-based staleness}: Submissions without passing grades
  (A, P, P+, complete) are cached for only [[SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES]] minutes,
  allowing students to see updated grades quickly.
\item \textbf{Periodic refresh}: Each cached collection ([[_all_fetched]]
  timestamps) has a time-to-live ([[DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days default,
  [[USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days for users, [[GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]] days
  for groups) after which the entire collection is refetched.
\item \textbf{Missing metadata}: Objects without [[_fetched_at]] attributes
  are treated as stale to ensure they get refreshed.
\end{enumerate}

When we log cache operations, we want to distinguish between these cases.
The [[get_staleness_reason()]] function mirrors [[outdated()]]'s logic but
returns human-readable diagnostic strings instead of booleans.
Both functions reference the same TTL constants, ensuring that log messages
accurately describe the cache behavior.

<<function [[get_staleness_reason]] to diagnose staleness>>=
def get_staleness_reason(obj):
  """
  Returns a descriptive string explaining why obj is stale, or None if fresh.
  Mirrors the logic in outdated() but returns human-readable reasons.
  Uses constants for TTL values to ensure consistency with outdated() logic.
  """
  <<check incomplete page and return reason>>
  <<check submission grade-based staleness and return reason>>
  <<check periodic refresh staleness and return reason>>
  return None
@

For Page objects without a [[body]] attribute, we return a reason indicating the
object is incomplete:
<<check incomplete page and return reason>>=
try:
  page_id = obj.page_id
  if not hasattr(obj, 'body') or obj.body is None:
    return "incomplete page object (missing body from get_pages())"
except AttributeError:
  pass
@

We log the specific reason for staleness to help diagnose cache behavior.
This distinguishes between the three staleness policies and shows how long
objects have been stale, making it clear why refreshes are occurring.

For grade-based staleness, we check if the submission has a non-passing grade
and if the TTL has expired:
<<check submission grade-based staleness and return reason>>=
try:
  if obj.grade not in NOREFRESH_GRADES:
    try:
      age = datetime.now() - obj._fetched_at
      ttl = timedelta(minutes=SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES)
      if age > ttl:
        expired_by = age - ttl
        return (f"non-passing grade ({obj.grade}), "
                f"{SUBMISSION_TTL_MINUTES}-minute TTL expired "
                f"{expired_by.total_seconds()/60:.1f} minutes ago")
    except AttributeError:
      return "non-passing grade, missing _fetched_at attribute"
except AttributeError:
  pass
@

For periodic refresh, we check the [[_all_fetched]] timestamps and report
which specific attribute triggered the refresh:
<<check periodic refresh staleness and return reason>>=
for attr_name in dir(obj):
  if attr_name == "user_all_fetched":
    attr_val = getattr(obj, attr_name, None)
    if attr_val:
      age = datetime.now() - attr_val
      threshold = timedelta(days=USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS)
      if age > threshold:
        return (f"periodic refresh: {attr_name} "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {USER_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
  elif attr_name in ["group_all_fetched", "group_category_all_fetched"]:
    attr_val = getattr(obj, attr_name, None)
    if attr_val:
      age = datetime.now() - attr_val
      threshold = timedelta(days=GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS)
      if age > threshold:
        return (f"periodic refresh: {attr_name} "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {GROUP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
  elif attr_name in ["quiz_all_fetched", "new_quiz_all_fetched"]:
    attr_val = getattr(obj, attr_name, None)
    if attr_val:
      age = datetime.now() - attr_val
      threshold = timedelta(days=QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS)
      if age > threshold:
        return (f"periodic refresh: {attr_name} "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
  elif attr_name.endswith("_all_fetched"):
    attr_val = getattr(obj, attr_name, None)
    if attr_val:
      age = datetime.now() - attr_val
      threshold = timedelta(days=DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS)
      if age > threshold:
        return (f"periodic refresh: {attr_name} "
                f"(age: {age.days} days, threshold: {DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_DAYS} days)")
@

<<functions>>=
<<function [[get_staleness_reason]] to diagnose staleness>>
@


\subsection{Caching courses}

The list of courses changes whenever new courses are created that we have
access to.
This usually happens well in advance, so we could have a rather long
time-to-live on the courses cache.

We use the [[CacheGetMethods]] decorator to add caching to the [[Canvas]] class
for its [[get_course]] and [[get_courses]] methods.
The decorator takes the attribute name [[course]] as argument.
<<functions>>=
def make_canvas_courses_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.canvas
  canvasapi.canvas.Canvas = CacheGetMethods("course")(canvasapi.canvas.Canvas)
@

Note that we don't need a TTLCache here, since the [[outdated]] function will
periodically reset the [[_all_fetched]] flag to trigger a refetch.


\subsection{Caching course contents}

Each course has assignments and users (students, teachers, TAs).
These change relatively infrequently:
Assignments are typically created at the beginning of the course and rarely
change after that.
Users are added at the beginning and occasionally during the course.

We use [[CacheGetMethods]] to cache both [[assignment]] and [[user]] attributes
of the [[Course]] class.
<<functions>>=
def make_course_contents_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("assignment")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("user")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
@

\subsection{Caching pages}

Pages are wiki-style content in Canvas courses.
Unlike assignments and users which are identified by numeric IDs, pages are
identified by URL slugs (e.g., \enquote{course-syllabus} or \enquote{week-1-overview}).
This requires using the [[cache_key='url']] parameter to cache by URL instead
of ID.

The Canvas API provides both [[get_page(url)]] (singular) and [[get_pages()]]
(plural) methods, so we cache both.
<<functions>>=
def make_course_pages_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("page", cache_key='url')(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
@


\subsection{Caching course structure}

Courses have structural elements that change very rarely after the course is
set up: assignment groups, modules, group categories, and groups.
These are typically created at course design time and remain stable throughout
the course.

Assignment groups organize assignments into categories (e.g., "Labs",
"Assignments", "Exams").
They're used frequently for filtering but almost never change after setup.
We cache both [[get_assignment_group()]] (singular) and [[get_assignment_groups()]]
(plural) since both are used in the codebase.
<<functions>>=
def make_course_assignment_groups_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("assignment_group")(
    canvasapi.course.Course)
@

Modules represent the learning structure of a course.
They're used for filtering assignments and rarely change after initial setup.
We cache both [[get_module()]] (singular) and [[get_modules()]] (plural).
<<functions>>=
def make_course_modules_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("module")(canvasapi.course.Course)
@

\subsubsection{Caching module items}

Each module contains items (assignments, pages, files, external URLs, etc.).
These items rarely change after the course is set up, making them good
candidates for caching.

The Canvas API provides both [[get_module_item(id)]] (singular) and
[[get_module_items()]] (plural) methods on the [[Module]] class.
<<functions>>=
def make_module_items_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.module
  canvasapi.module.Module = CacheGetMethods("module_item")(
    canvasapi.module.Module)
@

\subsubsection{Resolving module items to cached content objects}

Module items reference content by type-specific identifiers:
\begin{description}
\item[Assignment items] Reference assignments via [[content_id]] (numeric ID)
\item[Page items] Reference pages via [[page_url]] (URL slug)
\end{description}

When working with module contents, we often need to access the actual
[[Page]] or [[Assignment]] object, not just the [[ModuleItem]] wrapper.
By using the course's cached [[get_page()]] or [[get_assignment()]] methods,
we ensure that the returned objects are the same instances as those in the
page and assignment caches.
This provides object identity: a page accessed through a module item is the
same Python object as that page accessed directly.

We add resolution methods to the [[ModuleItem]] class:
\begin{description}
\item[[resolve_to_page(course)]] Returns the cached [[Page]] object for Page items
\item[[resolve_to_assignment(course)]] Returns the cached [[Assignment]] object
  for Assignment items
\item[[resolve(course)]] Generic method that returns the appropriate cached
  object based on item type
\end{description}

Each method requires the [[course]] parameter because page and assignment
caches are stored on the [[Course]] object, not on [[ModuleItem]] or [[Module]].
<<functions>>=
def make_module_item_resolvable():
  """Add resolution methods to ModuleItem for accessing cached content objects."""
  import canvasapi.module

  def resolve_to_page(self, course):

    item_type = getattr(self, 'type', None)

  canvasapi.module.ModuleItem.resolve_to_page = resolve_to_page
  canvasapi.module.ModuleItem.resolve_to_assignment = resolve_to_assignment
  canvasapi.module.ModuleItem.resolve = resolve

Group categories and groups organize students for collaborative work.
They're set up at course start or when group projects begin and change
infrequently.
The Canvas API only provides plural methods ([[get_group_categories()]],
[[get_groups()]]), not singular methods.
Note that groups can be fetched from both [[Course]] and [[GroupCategory]]
objects, so we cache on both.
For [[group_category]], the plural is irregular (``categories'' not
``categorys''), so we specify [[plural_name="group_categories"]].
<<functions>>=
def make_course_groups_cacheable():
  import canvasapi.course
  import canvasapi.group

\subsection{Caching quizzes}

Courses contain quizzes, which come in two flavors:
\begin{description}
\item[Classic Quizzes] The original Canvas quiz system, accessed via
  [[get_quiz()]] and [[get_quizzes()]].
  These return [[Quiz]] objects with attributes like [[quiz_type]].
\item[New Quizzes (Quizzes.Next)] Canvas's newer assessment engine, accessed via
  [[get_new_quiz()]] and [[get_new_quizzes()]].
  These return [[NewQuiz]] objects.
\end{description}

Quizzes are relatively stable---they're typically created at course design time
and their structure rarely changes during the course.
However, quiz settings (due dates, availability windows) may be adjusted more
frequently than assignments, so we use a shorter TTL of [[QUIZ_CACHE_TTL_DAYS]]
days rather than the default 7 days.

We cache both quiz types on the [[Course]] class.
Note that both use irregular plurals (\enquote{quizzes} not \enquote{quizs}), so
we must specify [[plural_name]].
<<functions>>=
def make_course_quizzes_cacheable():
  """Add caching to Course.get_quiz/get_quizzes and get_new_quiz/get_new_quizzes"""
  import canvasapi.course
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("quiz",
    plural_name="quizzes")(canvasapi.course.Course)
  canvasapi.course.Course = CacheGetMethods("new_quiz",
    plural_name="new_quizzes")(canvasapi.course.Course)
@

Now let's verify the quiz caching works correctly.

\subsubsection{Verifying quiz caching}

We test that the [[CacheGetMethods]] decorator correctly caches both Classic and
New Quizzes.

\subsection{Caching submissions}

For the results, we can construct something more specific.
Results that we're interested in are submissions.
We can only get submission from an assignment object.
We can either get all submissions, or one specific submission if we specify the 
user.
<<functions>>=
def make_assignment_submissions_cacheable():
  def cache_submissions(cls):
    """Class decorator for cacheable get_submission, get_submissions methods"""
    <<decorator body for caching assignment submissions>>
    return cls

  canvasapi.assignment.Assignment = \
    cache_submissions(canvasapi.assignment.Assignment)
@

Then we can write the decorator as follows.
We need to add a cache attribute in the constructor, so we must decorate the 
constructor.
The we must decorate both [[get_submission]] and [[get_submissions]].
<<decorator body for caching assignment submissions>>=
old_constructor = cls.__init__

@functools.wraps(cls.__init__)
def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<extend class constructor for decorators>>
  old_constructor(self, *args, **kwargs)

cls.__init__ = new_init

get_submission = cls.get_submission

@functools.wraps(cls.get_submission)
def new_get_submission(self, user, **kwargs):
  <<return submission of user>>

cls.get_submission = new_get_submission

get_submissions = cls.get_submissions

@functools.wraps(cls.get_submissions)
def new_get_submissions(self, *args, **kwargs):
  <<return a list of all submissions>>

cls.get_submissions = new_get_submissions
@

We decorate the method to get a specific submission, [[get_submission]].
This way we can cache the submissions of users who have passed.
Then we always return up-to-date submissions of students who are expected to 
update their submissions.
For this, we first need a cache attribute.
<<extend class constructor for decorators>>=
self.__cache = {}
@

Let's start with how we get an individual submission.
We also want to add info messages to log cache hits and misses and their 
timings.
<<return submission of user>>=
# canvasapi allows either User object or user ID.
if isinstance(user, User):
  uid = user.id
elif isinstance(user, int):
  uid = user
else:
  raise TypeError(f"user must be User or int")

submission = None

if "include" in kwargs:
  to_include = set(kwargs["include"])
else:
  to_include = set()

if must_refresh(uid, to_include, self.__cache):
  fetch_start = time.perf_counter()
  submission = get_submission(self, user, include=list(to_include))
  fetch_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - fetch_start
  submission._fetched_at = datetime.now()
  logger.info(f"Fetched submission user_id={uid} in {fetch_elapsed:.2f}s")
  self.__cache[uid] = (submission, to_include)
else:
  submission, _ = self.__cache[uid]

return submission
@ We also add the time of last fetch ([[._fetched_at]]), that way we don't need 
to update all the time, but with short intervals (see the [[outdated]] 
function).
<<functions>>=
def must_refresh(uid, to_include, cache):
  """
  Returns True if the submission needs refreshing based on kwargs.
  """
  cache_status = ""
  if uid in cache:
    submission, included = cache[uid]
    if not to_include.issubset(set(included)):
      cache_status = " (new include required)"
      submission = None
      to_include |= set(included)
  else:
    cache_status = " (not found)"
    submission = None

  if submission:
    if not outdated(submission):
      logger.info(f"Cache hit: submission user_id={uid}")
      return False
    elif not cache_status:
      reason = get_staleness_reason(submission)
      cache_status = f" (stale: {reason})" if reason else " (stale)"

  logger.info(f"Cache miss{cache_status}: submission user_id={uid}")
  return True
@

Now we can deal with [[get_submissions]].
As we might call [[get_submission]] before any [[get_submissions]], we cannot 
rely on the cache as a check.
We introduce a new attribute.
<<extend class constructor for decorators>>=
self.__all_fetched = None
@ Now we can check if this is set or not.
When we fetch, we want to include any data that was previously included.
<<return a list of all submissions>>=
if "include" in kwargs:
  to_include = set(kwargs["include"])
else:
  to_include = set()

# Collect everything to include from before.
for _, included in self.__cache.values():
  to_include |= included

if self.__all_fetched:
  cache_age = datetime.now() - self.__all_fetched
  logger.info(f"Using cached submissions for assignment id={self.id}: "
              f"{len(self.__cache)} submissions cached "
              f"(age: {cache_age.total_seconds()/60:.1f} minutes), "
              f"checking staleness to decide refresh strategy")
  num_needs_refresh = 0
  for submission, included in self.__cache.values():
    if must_refresh(submission.user_id, to_include, self.__cache):
      num_needs_refresh += 1
      if num_needs_refresh > THRESHOLD_INDIVIDUAL_REFRESH:
        break

  if num_needs_refresh <= THRESHOLD_INDIVIDUAL_REFRESH:
    logger.info(f"Refreshing {num_needs_refresh} individual submissions "
                f"for assignment id={self.id}")
    for submission, _ in self.__cache.values():
      # Use the cached method above to trigger any individual refreshes.
      self.get_submission(submission.user_id, include=list(to_include))
  else:
    logger.info(f"Refreshing all submissions for assignment id={self.id} "
                f"due to {num_needs_refresh} needing refresh")
    <<bulk refresh all submissions>>
else:

  logger.info(f"Fetching all submissions for assignment id={self.id}")
  <<bulk refresh all submissions>>

return [submission for submission, _ in self.__cache.values()]
<<bulk refresh all submissions>>=
start_fetch = time.perf_counter()
submissions = list(get_submissions(self, include=list(to_include)))
fetch_elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start_fetch
logger.info(f"Bulk refresh: {len(submissions)} submissions in "
            f"{fetch_elapsed:.2f}s")

for submission in submissions:
  submission._fetched_at = datetime.now()
  self.__cache[submission.user_id] = (submission, to_include)

self.__all_fetched = datetime.now()
@

Based on some tests, it takes Canvas roughly \qty{3}{\second} to return all 
submissions.
It takes Canvas roughly \qty{0.5}{\second} to return an individual submission.
So if we have more than 6 submissions to refresh, it's better to refresh them 
all at once.
<<constants>>=
THRESHOLD_INDIVIDUAL_REFRESH = 6
