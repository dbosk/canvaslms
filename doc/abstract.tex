This program provides a command-line interface for Canvas.
The command is \texttt{canvas} and it has several subcommands in the same style 
as Git.
\texttt{canvas} provides output in a format useful for POSIX tools, this makes 
automating tasks much easier.

Let's consider how to grade students logging into the student-shell SSH server.
We store the list of students' Canvas and KTH IDs in a file.
\begin{lstlisting}
canvas users -c DD1301 -s | cut -f 1,2 > students.tsv
\end{lstlisting}
Then we check who has logged into student-shell.
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=2]
ssh student-shell.sys.kth.se last | cut -f 1 -d " " | sort | uniq \
  > logged-in.tsv
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, we check who of our students logged in.
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=4]
for s in $(cut -f 2 students.tsv); do
  grep $s logged-in.tsv && \
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, we can set their grade to P and add the comment \enquote{Well done!} 
in Canvas.
We set the grades for the two assignments whose titles match the regular 
expression \texttt{(Preparing the terminal|The terminal)}.
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=6]
    canvas grade -c DD1301 -a "(Preparing the terminal|The terminal)" \
      -u $(grep $s students.tsv | cut -f 1) \
      -g P -m "Well done!"
done
\end{lstlisting}
